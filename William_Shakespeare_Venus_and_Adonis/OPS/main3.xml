<p>&#160;&#160;EVEN as the sun with purple-colour'd face</p>
<p>Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,</p>
<p>Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;</p>
<p>Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;</p>
<p>Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</p>
<p>And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Thrice-fairer than myself,' thus she began,</p>
<p>'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,</p>
<p>Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,</p>
<p>More white and red than doves or roses are;</p>
<p>Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,</p>
<p>Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,</p>
<p>And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;</p>
<p>If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed</p>
<p>A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:</p>
<p>Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</p>
<p>And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,</p>
<p>But rather famish them amid their plenty,</p>
<p>Making them red and pale with fresh variety,</p>
<p>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:</p>
<p>A summer's day will seem an hour but short,</p>
<p>Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,</p>
<p>The precedent of pith and livelihood,</p>
<p>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,</p>
<p>Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:</p>
<p>Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force</p>
<p>Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,</p>
<p>Under her other was the tender boy,</p>
<p>Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,</p>
<p>With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;</p>
<p>She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</p>
<p>He red for shame, but frosty in desire.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The studded bridle on a ragged bough</p>
<p>Nimbly she fastens:—O, how quick is love!—</p>
<p>The steed is stalled up, and even now</p>
<p>To tie the rider she begins to prove:</p>
<p>Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,</p>
<p>And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>So soon was she along as he was down,</p>
<p>Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:</p>
<p>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,</p>
<p>And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;</p>
<p>And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,</p>
<p>'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears</p>
<p>Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;</p>
<p>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</p>
<p>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:</p>
<p>He saith she is immodest, blames her 'miss;</p>
<p>What follows more she murders with a kiss.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,</p>
<p>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,</p>
<p>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</p>
<p>Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;</p>
<p>Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,</p>
<p>And where she ends she doth anew begin.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Forced to content, but never to obey,</p>
<p>Panting he lies and breatheth in her face;</p>
<p>She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,</p>
<p>And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;</p>
<p>Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,</p>
<p>So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,</p>
<p>So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;</p>
<p>Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,</p>
<p>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:</p>
<p>Rain added to a river that is rank</p>
<p>Perforce will force it overflow the bank.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,</p>
<p>For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;</p>
<p>Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,</p>
<p>'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:</p>
<p>Being red, she loves him best; and being white,</p>
<p>Her best is better'd with a more delight.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;</p>
<p>And by her fair immortal hand she swears,</p>
<p>From his soft bosom never to remove,</p>
<p>Till he take truce with her contending tears,</p>
<p>Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;</p>
<p>And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,</p>
<p>Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,</p>
<p>Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;</p>
<p>So offers he to give what she did crave;</p>
<p>But when her lips were ready for his pay,</p>
<p>He winks, and turns his lips another way.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Never did passenger in summer's heat</p>
<p>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.</p>
<p>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;</p>
<p>She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:</p>
<p>'O, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy!</p>
<p>'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,</p>
<p>Even by the stern and direful god of war,</p>
<p>Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,</p>
<p>Who conquers where he comes in every jar;</p>
<p>Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,</p>
<p>And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</p>
<p>His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,</p>
<p>And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,</p>
<p>To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,</p>
<p>Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,</p>
<p>Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Thus he that overruled I oversway'd,</p>
<p>Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:</p>
<p>Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,</p>
<p>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.</p>
<p>O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</p>
<p>For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,—</p>
<p>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red—</p>
<p>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.</p>
<p>What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:</p>
<p>Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;</p>
<p>Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?</p>
<p>'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,</p>
<p>And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;</p>
<p>Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;</p>
<p>Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:</p>
<p>These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean</p>
<p>Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip</p>
<p>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted:</p>
<p>Make use of time, let not advantage slip;</p>
<p>Beauty within itself should not be wasted:</p>
<p>Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime</p>
<p>Rot and consume themselves in little time.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,</p>
<p>Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,</p>
<p>O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,</p>
<p>Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,</p>
<p>Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee</p>
<p>But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;</p>
<p>Mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning:</p>
<p>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</p>
<p>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;</p>
<p>My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</p>
<p>Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</p>
<p>Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,</p>
<p>Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,</p>
<p>Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:</p>
<p>Love is a spirit all compact of fire,</p>
<p>Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;</p>
<p>These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;</p>
<p>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,</p>
<p>From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:</p>
<p>Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be</p>
<p>That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?</p>
<p>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?</p>
<p>Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,</p>
<p>Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.</p>
<p>Narcissus so himself himself forsook,</p>
<p>And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</p>
<p>Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,</p>
<p>Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:</p>
<p>Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:</p>
<p>Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;</p>
<p>Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,</p>
<p>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</p>
<p>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</p>
<p>That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;</p>
<p>And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,</p>
<p>In that thy likeness still is left alive.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,</p>
<p>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,</p>
<p>And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat,</p>
<p>With burning eye did hotly overlook them;</p>
<p>Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,</p>
<p>So he were like him and by Venus' side.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And now Adonis, with a lazy spright,</p>
<p>And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,</p>
<p>His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,</p>
<p>Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,</p>
<p>Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie, no more of love!</p>
<p>The sun doth burn my face: I must remove.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind?</p>
<p>What bare excuses makest thou to be gone!</p>
<p>I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</p>
<p>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:</p>
<p>I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;</p>
<p>If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</p>
<p>And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:</p>
<p>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</p>
<p>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;</p>
<p>And were I not immortal, life were done</p>
<p>Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,</p>
<p>Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth?</p>
<p>Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel</p>
<p>What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?</p>
<p>O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,</p>
<p>She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'What am I, that thou shouldst contemn me this?</p>
<p>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?</p>
<p>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</p>
<p>Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:</p>
<p>Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,</p>
<p>And one for interest, if thou wilt have twain.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,</p>
<p>Well-painted idol, image dun and dead,</p>
<p>Statue contenting but the eye alone,</p>
<p>Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!</p>
<p>Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,</p>
<p>For men will kiss even by their own direction.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</p>
<p>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;</p>
<p>Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;</p>
<p>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:</p>
<p>And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,</p>
<p>And now her sobs do her intendments break.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,</p>
<p>Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;</p>
<p>Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:</p>
<p>She would, he will not in her arms be bound;</p>
<p>And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</p>
<p>She locks her lily fingers one in one.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here</p>
<p>Within the circuit of this ivory pale,</p>
<p>I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;</p>
<p>Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:</p>
<p>Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,</p>
<p>Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Within this limit is relief enough,</p>
<p>Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,</p>
<p>Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,</p>
<p>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain</p>
<p>Then be my deer, since I am such a park;</p>
<p>No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</p>
<p>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:</p>
<p>Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</p>
<p>He might be buried in a tomb so simple;</p>
<p>Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</p>
<p>Why, there Love lived and there he could not die.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,</p>
<p>Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.</p>
<p>Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?</p>
<p>Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?</p>
<p>Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,</p>
<p>To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?</p>
<p>Her words are done, her woes are more increasing;</p>
<p>The time is spent, her object will away,</p>
<p>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.</p>
<p>'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'</p>
<p>Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,</p>
<p>A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,</p>
<p>Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,</p>
<p>And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:</p>
<p>The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,</p>
<p>Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</p>
<p>And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;</p>
<p>The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</p>
<p>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;</p>
<p>The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,</p>
<p>Controlling what he was controlled with.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane</p>
<p>Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;</p>
<p>His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,</p>
<p>As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:</p>
<p>His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,</p>
<p>Shows his hot courage and his high desire.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,</p>
<p>With gentle majesty and modest pride;</p>
<p>Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,</p>
<p>As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried,</p>
<p>And this I do to captivate the eye</p>
<p>Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>What recketh he his rider's angry stir,</p>
<p>His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?</p>
<p>What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?</p>
<p>For rich caparisons or trapping gay?</p>
<p>He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,</p>
<p>For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Look, when a painter would surpass the life,</p>
<p>In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,</p>
<p>His art with nature's workmanship at strife,</p>
<p>As if the dead the living should exceed;</p>
<p>So did this horse excel a common one</p>
<p>In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</p>
<p>Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,</p>
<p>High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,</p>
<p>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</p>
<p>Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,</p>
<p>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;</p>
<p>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;</p>
<p>To bid the wind a base he now prepares,</p>
<p>And whether he run or fly they know not whether;</p>
<p>For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</p>
<p>Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He looks upon his love and neighs unto her;</p>
<p>She answers him as if she knew his mind:</p>
<p>Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,</p>
<p>She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,</p>
<p>Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,</p>
<p>Beating his kind embracements with her heels.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Then, like a melancholy malcontent,</p>
<p>He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,</p>
<p>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:</p>
<p>He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.</p>
<p>His love, perceiving how he is enraged,</p>
<p>Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>His testy master goeth about to take him;</p>
<p>When, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear,</p>
<p>Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,</p>
<p>With her the horse, and left Adonis there:</p>
<p>As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,</p>
<p>Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,</p>
<p>Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:</p>
<p>And now the happy season once more fits,</p>
<p>That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;</p>
<p>For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong</p>
<p>When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,</p>
<p>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:</p>
<p>So of concealed sorrow may be said;</p>
<p>Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;</p>
<p>But when the heart's attorney once is mute,</p>
<p>The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,</p>
<p>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</p>
<p>And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;</p>
<p>Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,</p>
<p>Taking no notice that she is so nigh,</p>
<p>For all askance he holds her in his eye.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>O, what a sight it was, wistly to view</p>
<p>How she came stealing to the wayward boy!</p>
<p>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</p>
<p>How white and red each other did destroy!</p>
<p>But now her cheek was pale, and by and by</p>
<p>It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now was she just before him as he sat,</p>
<p>And like a lowly lover down she kneels;</p>
<p>With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,</p>
<p>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:</p>
<p>His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,</p>
<p>As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>O, what a war of looks was then between them!</p>
<p>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;</p>
<p>His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;</p>
<p>Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:</p>
<p>And all this dumb play had his acts made plain</p>
<p>With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Full gently now she takes him by the hand,</p>
<p>A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,</p>
<p>Or ivory in an alabaster band;</p>
<p>So white a friend engirts so white a foe:</p>
<p>This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,</p>
<p>Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:</p>
<p>'O fairest mover on this mortal round,</p>
<p>Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,</p>
<p>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;</p>
<p>For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,</p>
<p>Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'</p>
<p>'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it:</p>
<p>O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,</p>
<p>And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:</p>
<p>Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,</p>
<p>Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;</p>
<p>My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,</p>
<p>And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:</p>
<p>I pray you hence, and leave me here alone;</p>
<p>For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</p>
<p>Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,</p>
<p>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:</p>
<p>Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;</p>
<p>Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:</p>
<p>The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;</p>
<p>Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,</p>
<p>Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!</p>
<p>But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,</p>
<p>He held such petty bondage in disdain;</p>
<p>Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,</p>
<p>Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,</p>
<p>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</p>
<p>But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</p>
<p>His other agents aim at like delight?</p>
<p>Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold</p>
<p>To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;</p>
<p>And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,</p>
<p>To take advantage on presented joy;</p>
<p>Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;</p>
<p>O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,</p>
<p>And once made perfect, never lost again.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,</p>
<p>Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;</p>
<p>'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;</p>
<p>My love to love is love but to disgrace it;</p>
<p>For I have heard it is a life in death,</p>
<p>That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?</p>
<p>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?</p>
<p>If springing things be any jot diminish'd,</p>
<p>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:</p>
<p>The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young</p>
<p>Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,</p>
<p>And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:</p>
<p>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;</p>
<p>To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:</p>
<p>Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;</p>
<p>For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?</p>
<p>O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!</p>
<p>Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;</p>
<p>I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:</p>
<p>Melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,</p>
<p>Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love</p>
<p>That inward beauty and invisible;</p>
<p>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move</p>
<p>Each part in me that were but sensible:</p>
<p>Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,</p>
<p>Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</p>
<p>And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,</p>
<p>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</p>
<p>Yet would my love to thee be still as much;</p>
<p>For from the stillitory of thy face excelling</p>
<p>Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by</p>
<p>smelling.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'But, O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,</p>
<p>Being nurse and feeder of the other four!</p>
<p>Would they not wish the feast might ever last,</p>
<p>And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,</p>
<p>Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</p>
<p>Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,</p>
<p>Which to his speech did honey passage yield;</p>
<p>Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd</p>
<p>Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,</p>
<p>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</p>
<p>Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:</p>
<p>Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,</p>
<p>Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,</p>
<p>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,</p>
<p>Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</p>
<p>His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And at his look she flatly falleth down,</p>
<p>For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;</p>
<p>A smile recures the wounding of a frown;</p>
<p>But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!</p>
<p>The silly boy, believing she is dead,</p>
<p>Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And all amazed brake off his late intent,</p>
<p>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</p>
<p>Which cunning love did wittily prevent:</p>
<p>Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!</p>
<p>For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</p>
<p>Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</p>
<p>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,</p>
<p>He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks</p>
<p>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:</p>
<p>He kisses her; and she, by her good will,</p>
<p>Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:</p>
<p>Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,</p>
<p>Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array</p>
<p>He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;</p>
<p>And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</p>
<p>So is her face illumined with her eye;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,</p>
<p>As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.</p>
<p>Were never four such lamps together mix'd,</p>
<p>Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;</p>
<p>But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,</p>
<p>Shone like the moon in water seen by night.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'O, where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,</p>
<p>Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?</p>
<p>What hour is this? or morn or weary even?</p>
<p>Do I delight to die, or life desire?</p>
<p>But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;</p>
<p>But now I died, and death was lively joy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again:</p>
<p>Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,</p>
<p>Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain</p>
<p>That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;</p>
<p>And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,</p>
<p>But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!</p>
<p>O, never let their crimson liveries wear!</p>
<p>And as they last, their verdure still endure,</p>
<p>To drive infection from the dangerous year!</p>
<p>That the star-gazers, having writ on death,</p>
<p>May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,</p>
<p>What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?</p>
<p>To sell myself I can be well contented,</p>
<p>So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;</p>
<p>Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips</p>
<p>Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;</p>
<p>And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.</p>
<p>What is ten hundred touches unto thee?</p>
<p>Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?</p>
<p>Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,</p>
<p>Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,</p>
<p>Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:</p>
<p>Before I know myself, seek not to know me;</p>
<p>No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:</p>
<p>The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,</p>
<p>Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,</p>
<p>His day's hot task hath ended in the west;</p>
<p>The owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''Tis very late;'</p>
<p>The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,</p>
<p>And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light</p>
<p>Do summon us to part and bid good night.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;</p>
<p>If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'</p>
<p>'Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'</p>
<p>The honey fee of parting tender'd is:</p>
<p>Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;</p>
<p>Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew</p>
<p>The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,</p>
<p>Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,</p>
<p>Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:</p>
<p>He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth</p>
<p>Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,</p>
<p>And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;</p>
<p>Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,</p>
<p>Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;</p>
<p>Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,</p>
<p>That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,</p>
<p>With blindfold fury she begins to forage;</p>
<p>Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,</p>
<p>And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,</p>
<p>Planting oblivion, beating reason back,</p>
<p>Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,</p>
<p>Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,</p>
<p>Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,</p>
<p>Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,</p>
<p>He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,</p>
<p>While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,</p>
<p>And yields at last to every light impression?</p>
<p>Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,</p>
<p>Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:</p>
<p>Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,</p>
<p>But then woos best when most his choice is froward.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,</p>
<p>Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.</p>
<p>Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;</p>
<p>What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd:</p>
<p>Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,</p>
<p>Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For pity now she can no more detain him;</p>
<p>The poor fool prays her that he may depart:</p>
<p>She is resolved no longer to restrain him;</p>
<p>Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,</p>
<p>The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,</p>
<p>He carries thence incaged in his breast.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,</p>
<p>For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.</p>
<p>Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?</p>
<p>Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'</p>
<p>He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends</p>
<p>To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,</p>
<p>Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,</p>
<p>Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,</p>
<p>And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:</p>
<p>She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,</p>
<p>He on her belly falls, she on her back.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now is she in the very lists of love,</p>
<p>Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:</p>
<p>All is imaginary she doth prove,</p>
<p>He will not manage her, although he mount her;</p>
<p>That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,</p>
<p>To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,</p>
<p>Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,</p>
<p>Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,</p>
<p>As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.</p>
<p>The warm effects which she in him finds missing</p>
<p>She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>But all in vain; good queen, it will not be:</p>
<p>She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;</p>
<p>Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee;</p>
<p>She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.</p>
<p>'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;</p>
<p>You have no reason to withhold me so.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,</p>
<p>But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.</p>
<p>O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is</p>
<p>With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,</p>
<p>Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,</p>
<p>Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'On his bow-back he hath a battle set</p>
<p>Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;</p>
<p>His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;</p>
<p>His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;</p>
<p>Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,</p>
<p>And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,</p>
<p>Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;</p>
<p>His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;</p>
<p>Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:</p>
<p>The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,</p>
<p>As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,</p>
<p>To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;</p>
<p>Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,</p>
<p>Whose full perfection all the world amazes;</p>
<p>But having thee at vantage,—wondrous dread!—</p>
<p>Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;</p>
<p>Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:</p>
<p>Come not within his danger by thy will;</p>
<p>They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.</p>
<p>When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,</p>
<p>I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?</p>
<p>Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?</p>
<p>Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright?</p>
<p>Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,</p>
<p>My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,</p>
<p>But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy</p>
<p>Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;</p>
<p>Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,</p>
<p>And in a peaceful hour doth cry 'Kill, kill!'</p>
<p>Distempering gentle Love in his desire,</p>
<p>As air and water do abate the fire.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,</p>
<p>This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,</p>
<p>This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,</p>
<p>That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,</p>
<p>Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear</p>
<p>That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye</p>
<p>The picture of an angry-chafing boar,</p>
<p>Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie</p>
<p>An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;</p>
<p>Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed</p>
<p>Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,</p>
<p>That tremble at the imagination?</p>
<p>The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,</p>
<p>And fear doth teach it divination:</p>
<p>I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,</p>
<p>If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;</p>
<p>Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,</p>
<p>Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,</p>
<p>Or at the roe which no encounter dare:</p>
<p>Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,</p>
<p>And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy</p>
<p>hounds.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,</p>
<p>Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles</p>
<p>How he outruns the wind and with what care</p>
<p>He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:</p>
<p>The many musets through the which he goes</p>
<p>Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,</p>
<p>To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,</p>
<p>And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,</p>
<p>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,</p>
<p>And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:</p>
<p>Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'For there his smell with others being mingled,</p>
<p>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</p>
<p>Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled</p>
<p>With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;</p>
<p>Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,</p>
<p>As if another chase were in the skies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,</p>
<p>Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,</p>
<p>To harken if his foes pursue him still:</p>
<p>Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;</p>
<p>And now his grief may be compared well</p>
<p>To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch</p>
<p>Turn, and return, indenting with the way;</p>
<p>Each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,</p>
<p>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:</p>
<p>For misery is trodden on by many,</p>
<p>And being low never relieved by any.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Lie quietly, and hear a little more;</p>
<p>Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:</p>
<p>To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,</p>
<p>Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,</p>
<p>Applying this to that, and so to so;</p>
<p>For love can comment upon every woe.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he,</p>
<p>'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:</p>
<p>The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.</p>
<p>'I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;</p>
<p>And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'</p>
<p>'In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this,</p>
<p>The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,</p>
<p>And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.</p>
<p>Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips</p>
<p>Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,</p>
<p>Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:</p>
<p>Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,</p>
<p>Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,</p>
<p>For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;</p>
<p>Wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite,</p>
<p>To shame the sun by day and her by night.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies</p>
<p>To cross the curious workmanship of nature,</p>
<p>To mingle beauty with infirmities,</p>
<p>And pure perfection with impure defeature,</p>
<p>Making it subject to the tyranny</p>
<p>Of mad mischances and much misery;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,</p>
<p>Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,</p>
<p>The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint</p>
<p>Disorder breeds by heating of the blood:</p>
<p>Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,</p>
<p>Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'And not the least of all these maladies</p>
<p>But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:</p>
<p>Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,</p>
<p>Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,</p>
<p>Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,</p>
<p>As mountain-snow melts with the midday sun.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,</p>
<p>Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,</p>
<p>That on the earth would breed a scarcity</p>
<p>And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,</p>
<p>Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night</p>
<p>Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'What is thy body but a swallowing grave,</p>
<p>Seeming to bury that posterity</p>
<p>Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,</p>
<p>If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?</p>
<p>If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,</p>
<p>Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'So in thyself thyself art made away;</p>
<p>A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,</p>
<p>Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,</p>
<p>Or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life.</p>
<p>Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,</p>
<p>But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Nay, then,' quoth Adon, 'you will fall again</p>
<p>Into your idle over-handled theme:</p>
<p>The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,</p>
<p>And all in vain you strive against the stream;</p>
<p>For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse,</p>
<p>Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,</p>
<p>And every tongue more moving than your own,</p>
<p>Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,</p>
<p>Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown</p>
<p>For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,</p>
<p>And will not let a false sound enter there;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Lest the deceiving harmony should run</p>
<p>Into the quiet closure of my breast;</p>
<p>And then my little heart were quite undone,</p>
<p>In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.</p>
<p>No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,</p>
<p>But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'What have you urged that I cannot reprove?</p>
<p>The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger:</p>
<p>I hate not love, but your device in love,</p>
<p>That lends embracements unto every stranger.</p>
<p>You do it for increase: O strange excuse,</p>
<p>When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,</p>
<p>Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;</p>
<p>Under whose simple semblance he hath fed</p>
<p>Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;</p>
<p>Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,</p>
<p>As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,</p>
<p>But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;</p>
<p>Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,</p>
<p>Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;</p>
<p>Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;</p>
<p>Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'More I could tell, but more I dare not say;</p>
<p>The text is old, the orator too green.</p>
<p>Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;</p>
<p>My face is full of shame, my heart of teen:</p>
<p>Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,</p>
<p>Do burn themselves for having so offended.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,</p>
<p>Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,</p>
<p>And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;</p>
<p>Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.</p>
<p>Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,</p>
<p>So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Which after him she darts, as one on shore</p>
<p>Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,</p>
<p>Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,</p>
<p>Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:</p>
<p>So did the merciless and pitchy night</p>
<p>Fold in the object that did feed her sight.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whereat amazed, as one that unaware</p>
<p>Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,</p>
<p>Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,</p>
<p>Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,</p>
<p>Even so confounded in the dark she lay,</p>
<p>Having lost the fair discovery of her way.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</p>
<p>That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,</p>
<p>Make verbal repetition of her moans;</p>
<p>Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:</p>
<p>'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'Woe, woe!'</p>
<p>And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>She marking them begins a wailing note</p>
<p>And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;</p>
<p>How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;</p>
<p>How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty:</p>
<p>Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,</p>
<p>And still the choir of echoes answer so.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Her song was tedious and outwore the night,</p>
<p>For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:</p>
<p>If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight</p>
<p>In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:</p>
<p>Their copious stories oftentimes begun</p>
<p>End without audience and are never done.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For who hath she to spend the night withal</p>
<p>But idle sounds resembling parasites,</p>
<p>Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,</p>
<p>Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?</p>
<p>She says ''Tis so:' they answer all ''Tis so;'</p>
<p>And would say after her, if she said 'No.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</p>
<p>From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</p>
<p>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</p>
<p>The sun ariseth in his majesty;</p>
<p>Who doth the world so gloriously behold</p>
<p>That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:</p>
<p>'O thou clear god, and patron of all light,</p>
<p>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</p>
<p>The beauteous influence that makes him bright,</p>
<p>There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,</p>
<p>May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,</p>
<p>Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,</p>
<p>And yet she hears no tidings of her love:</p>
<p>She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:</p>
<p>Anon she hears them chant it lustily,</p>
<p>And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And as she runs, the bushes in the way</p>
<p>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,</p>
<p>Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:</p>
<p>She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,</p>
<p>Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,</p>
<p>Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;</p>
<p>Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder</p>
<p>Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,</p>
<p>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;</p>
<p>Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</p>
<p>Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,</p>
<p>But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,</p>
<p>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</p>
<p>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:</p>
<p>Finding their enemy to be so curst,</p>
<p>They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,</p>
<p>Through which it enters to surprise her heart;</p>
<p>Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,</p>
<p>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:</p>
<p>Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,</p>
<p>They basely fly and dare not stay the field.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;</p>
<p>Till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,</p>
<p>She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,</p>
<p>And childish error, that they are afraid;</p>
<p>Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:—</p>
<p>And with that word she spied the hunted boar,</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,</p>
<p>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</p>
<p>A second fear through all her sinews spread,</p>
<p>Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:</p>
<p>This way runs, and now she will no further,</p>
<p>But back retires to rate the boar for murther.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;</p>
<p>She treads the path that she untreads again;</p>
<p>Her more than haste is mated with delays,</p>
<p>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</p>
<p>Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;</p>
<p>In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,</p>
<p>And asks the weary caitiff for his master,</p>
<p>And there another licking of his wound,</p>
<p>'Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;</p>
<p>And here she meets another sadly scowling,</p>
<p>To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,</p>
<p>Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,</p>
<p>Against the welkin volleys out his voice;</p>
<p>Another and another answer him,</p>
<p>Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,</p>
<p>Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Look, how the world's poor people are amazed</p>
<p>At apparitions, signs and prodigies,</p>
<p>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</p>
<p>Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;</p>
<p>So she at these sad signs draws up her breath</p>
<p>And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,</p>
<p>Hateful divorce of love,'—thus chides she Death,—</p>
<p>'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean</p>
<p>To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,</p>
<p>Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set</p>
<p>Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'If he be dead,—O no, it cannot be,</p>
<p>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:—</p>
<p>O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,</p>
<p>But hatefully at random dost thou hit.</p>
<p>Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart</p>
<p>Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,</p>
<p>And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.</p>
<p>The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;</p>
<p>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:</p>
<p>Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,</p>
<p>And not Death's ebon dart, to strike dead.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?</p>
<p>What may a heavy groan advantage thee?</p>
<p>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</p>
<p>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?</p>
<p>Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,</p>
<p>Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Here overcome, as one full of despair,</p>
<p>She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt</p>
<p>The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair</p>
<p>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;</p>
<p>But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,</p>
<p>And with his strong course opens them again.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!</p>
<p>Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;</p>
<p>Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,</p>
<p>Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;</p>
<p>But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</p>
<p>Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Variable passions throng her constant woe,</p>
<p>As striving who should best become her grief;</p>
<p>All entertain'd, each passion labours so,</p>
<p>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</p>
<p>But none is best: then join they all together,</p>
<p>Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;</p>
<p>A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well:</p>
<p>The dire imagination she did follow</p>
<p>This sound of hope doth labour to expel;</p>
<p>For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,</p>
<p>And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</p>
<p>Being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;</p>
<p>Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,</p>
<p>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,</p>
<p>To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,</p>
<p>Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>O hard-believing love, how strange it seems</p>
<p>Not to believe, and yet too credulous!</p>
<p>Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;</p>
<p>Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:</p>
<p>The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</p>
<p>In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;</p>
<p>Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;</p>
<p>It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught:</p>
<p>Now she adds honours to his hateful name;</p>
<p>She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,</p>
<p>Imperious supreme of all mortal things.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;</p>
<p>Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear</p>
<p>When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,</p>
<p>Which knows no pity, but is still severe;</p>
<p>Then, gentle shadow,—truth I must confess,—</p>
<p>I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>''Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue;</p>
<p>Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;</p>
<p>'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;</p>
<p>I did but act, he's author of thy slander:</p>
<p>Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet</p>
<p>Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,</p>
<p>Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;</p>
<p>And that his beauty may the better thrive,</p>
<p>With Death she humbly doth insinuate;</p>
<p>Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories</p>
<p>His victories, his triumphs and his glories.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I</p>
<p>To be of such a weak and silly mind</p>
<p>To wail his death who lives and must not die</p>
<p>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!</p>
<p>For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</p>
<p>And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear</p>
<p>As one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;</p>
<p>Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,</p>
<p>Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'</p>
<p>Even at this word she hears a merry horn,</p>
<p>Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>As falcon to the lure, away she flies;</p>
<p>The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;</p>
<p>And in her haste unfortunately spies</p>
<p>The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;</p>
<p>Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,</p>
<p>Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,</p>
<p>Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,</p>
<p>And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,</p>
<p>Long after fearing to creep forth again;</p>
<p>So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled</p>
<p>Into the deep dark cabins of her head:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Where they resign their office and their light</p>
<p>To the disposing of her troubled brain;</p>
<p>Who bids them still consort with ugly night,</p>
<p>And never wound the heart with looks again;</p>
<p>Who like a king perplexed in his throne,</p>
<p>By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whereat each tributary subject quakes;</p>
<p>As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,</p>
<p>Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,</p>
<p>Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.</p>
<p>This mutiny each part doth so surprise</p>
<p>That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>And, being open'd, threw unwilling light</p>
<p>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd</p>
<p>In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white</p>
<p>With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:</p>
<p>No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,</p>
<p>But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth;</p>
<p>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;</p>
<p>Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;</p>
<p>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:</p>
<p>Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;</p>
<p>Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</p>
<p>That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;</p>
<p>And then she reprehends her mangling eye,</p>
<p>That makes more gashes where no breach should be:</p>
<p>His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;</p>
<p>For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,</p>
<p>And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!</p>
<p>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</p>
<p>Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:</p>
<p>Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!</p>
<p>So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</p>
<p>What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?</p>
<p>Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast</p>
<p>Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?</p>
<p>The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;</p>
<p>But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!</p>
<p>Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:</p>
<p>Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;</p>
<p>The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you:</p>
<p>But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air</p>
<p>Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</p>
<p>Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;</p>
<p>The wind would blow it off and, being gone,</p>
<p>Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;</p>
<p>And straight, in pity of his tender years,</p>
<p>They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'To see his face the lion walk'd along</p>
<p>Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;</p>
<p>To recreate himself when he hath sung,</p>
<p>The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;</p>
<p>If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey</p>
<p>And never fright the silly lamb that day.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'When he beheld his shadow in the brook,</p>
<p>The fishes spread on it their golden gills;</p>
<p>When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,</p>
<p>That some would sing, some other in their bills</p>
<p>Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries;</p>
<p>He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,</p>
<p>Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,</p>
<p>Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;</p>
<p>Witness the entertainment that he gave:</p>
<p>If he did see his face, why then I know</p>
<p>He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:</p>
<p>He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,</p>
<p>Who did not whet his teeth at him again,</p>
<p>But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;</p>
<p>And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine</p>
<p>Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,</p>
<p>With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;</p>
<p>But he is dead, and never did he bless</p>
<p>My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'</p>
<p>With this, she falleth in the place she stood,</p>
<p>And stains her face with his congealed blood.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;</p>
<p>She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;</p>
<p>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</p>
<p>As if they heard the woeful words she told;</p>
<p>She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,</p>
<p>Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Two glasses, where herself herself beheld</p>
<p>A thousand times, and now no more reflect;</p>
<p>Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,</p>
<p>And every beauty robb'd of his effect:</p>
<p>'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,</p>
<p>That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy:</p>
<p>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:</p>
<p>It shall be waited on with jealousy,</p>
<p>Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,</p>
<p>Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,</p>
<p>That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,</p>
<p>Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;</p>
<p>The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd</p>
<p>With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:</p>
<p>The strongest body shall it make most weak,</p>
<p>Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,</p>
<p>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;</p>
<p>The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</p>
<p>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;</p>
<p>It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,</p>
<p>Make the young old, the old become a child.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;</p>
<p>It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;</p>
<p>It shall be merciful and too severe,</p>
<p>And most deceiving when it seems most just;</p>
<p>Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,</p>
<p>Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'It shall be cause of war and dire events,</p>
<p>And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;</p>
<p>Subject and servile to all discontents,</p>
<p>As dry combustious matter is to fire:</p>
<p>Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,</p>
<p>They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd</p>
<p>Was melted like a vapour from her sight,</p>
<p>And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,</p>
<p>A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,</p>
<p>Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</p>
<p>Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,</p>
<p>Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,</p>
<p>And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,</p>
<p>Since he himself is reft from her by death:</p>
<p>She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears</p>
<p>Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise—</p>
<p>Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire—</p>
<p>For every little grief to wet his eyes:</p>
<p>To grow unto himself was his desire,</p>
<p>And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good</p>
<p>To wither in my breast as in his blood.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;</p>
<p>Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:</p>
<p>Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,</p>
<p>My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:</p>
<p>There shall not be one minute in an hour</p>
<p>Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Thus weary of the world, away she hies,</p>
<p>And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid</p>
<p>Their mistress mounted through the empty skies</p>
<p>In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;</p>
<p>Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen</p>
<p>Means to immure herself and not be seen.</p>
