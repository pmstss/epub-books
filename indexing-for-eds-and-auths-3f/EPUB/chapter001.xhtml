<section title="A Brief History">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-1"><strong><a id="pinpt3"/>A BRIEF HISTORY</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt4"/>Indexes have been around for nearly as long as the written word. As soon as a store of knowledge became too great to hold in one&#x2019;s brain, then an index, or &#x201C;pointer&#x201D; to the information, was needed. The great Greek Alexandrian Library contained more than 400,000 written scrolls. Imagine the time it would take to unroll each scroll in turn to find the information you needed. To preserve the scrolls and help solve that problem, the scrolls were kept in clay jars, and each jar contained a listing of its contents.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt5"/>Later, when the codex, or book form, developed, guides to a book&#x2019;s contents, called either an &#x201C;index&#x201D; or a &#x201C;table,&#x201D; were created. After the invention of printing, when it was possible to create multiple identical copies of a text, indexes came into their own. Gradually through the centuries, indexes took the form in which we know them today, that is, fully alphabetical arrays of entries with locators that point readers to the place in the text where they can find a specific piece of information.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt6"/>Such indexes may also be prepared for journals and newspapers or other periodicals. In addition, many Web sites also contain indexes to help users link to specific information quickly.</p>
</section>
<section title="Purposes: What Do Indexes Do?">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-2"><strong><a id="pinpt7"/>PURPOSES: WHAT DO INDEXES DO?</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt8"/>Indexes provide access to information. They do this by collecting together in one place similar concepts from disparate sections of the text (a process called &#x201C;collocation&#x201D;). The terms representing the various collected concepts are then presented to the user in a known or stated searchable order. While we generally think of indexes as being in alphabetical order, other orders are possible. An index to a catalog of car parts, for example, might be in numerical order.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt9"/>It is important to note that the purpose of the index is not to repeat information in the text, but merely to point the user to it. Thus the sentence &#x201C;Henry VIII presided over his kingdom from his residence at Whitehall Palace&#x201D; might be indexed as:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p2" title="2"/><div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt10"/>Henry VIII</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt11"/>residence</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pinpt12"/>but not as:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt13"/>Henry VIII</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt14"/>residence at Whitehall Palace</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt15"/>One of the goals of an index is to present information to the reader in as concise a manner as possible. Repeating large chunks of text in the index would simply make it unwieldy to use, actually making it more difficult for the reader to scan the index easily to find the information he or she wants.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt16"/>In creating an index, the context in which it appears becomes important. There are three distinct areas that the indexer needs to take into account: the business context, index users, and content. We will take a look at each of these in turn.</p>
</section>
<section title="Business Context">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-3"><strong><a id="pinpt17"/>BUSINESS CONTEXT</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt18"/>Why is this index being created? What purpose will it serve? Is it a marketing tool? One reference book, <em>Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography</em> (1995), boasts of its indexes on the back cover. Clearly the editors considered the information access mechanisms an important selling point. Accordingly, special attention was no doubt paid to the creation of the book&#x2019;s indexes. In the <em>Oxford Dictionary of Quotations</em> (1999), the index comprises 27 percent of the total length of the book, demonstrating its importance for users.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt19"/>Serving as an index may be the sole purpose of a publication. Think of the <em>Reader&#x2019;s Guide to Periodical Literature</em>, for example. The index <em>is</em> the book, whose sole <em>raison d&#x2019;etre</em> is to direct readers to primary source material.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt20"/>The purpose of the index will influence such decisions as how much time to allot for indexing, how exhaustive to make the index (that is, whether to index specific information or only broader topics), and how many pages to make available for the index.</p>
</section>
<section title="Index Users">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-4"><strong><a id="pinpt21"/>INDEX USERS</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt22"/>Generally, there are two types of users that indexers must keep in mind:</p>
<ol class="olindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt23"/>People who have not read the book, but are perusing the index before they buy it to find out what kinds of information it contains</li>
<li class="litop"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p3" title="3"/><a id="pinpt24"/>Those who have previously read the book and are consulting the index to find something they know they had seen in the text (called &#x201C;known-item finding&#x201D;)</li></ol>
<p><a id="pinpt25"/>Some might list a third user type: those who check the index of a book to see whether their name is mentioned in the text. But we don&#x2019;t need to be concerned here about such &#x201C;vanity&#x201D; index readers.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt26"/>Each user group carries different implications for the index. In the first instance, for example, it is important that the index provide headings for the main topic areas covered in the text. In the second, the index must provide entries at a rather specific level for significant mentions of people, places, things, and concepts.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt27"/>While every significant mention should be indexed, that does not imply that every single word of the text should appear in the index. In fact, they should not. Including every instance of every word means that often the user will find no relevant information. And one important job of the index is to ensure the reader&#x2019;s satisfaction at landing on a specific place in the text as directed from the index.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt28"/>There are occasions when each word in a text is indexed; such word listings are known as concordances. The Bible and Shakespeare&#x2019;s works have often had concordances prepared for them, for example. A concordance, however, is not a subject index; it is merely a list of terms like nouns, adjectives, and verbs.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt29"/>Also important for indexing considerations are the characteristics of the audience that will be buying or using the text. Is the book a manual intended for a knowledgeable professional audience, or is it a general book for the lay audience? Are there multiple audiences?</p>
<p><a id="pinpt30"/>Such questions will influence the terminology of the index and the use of multiple access points in the index. A medical textbook might include the term &#x201C;oncology&#x201D; in the index, while a general health book would use the term &#x201C;cancer.&#x201D; An online medical information site used by both professionals and general audiences would probably want to include both terms in an index.</p>
</section>
<section title="Content">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-5"><strong><a id="pinpt31"/>CONTENT</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt32"/>What is the nature of the specific material being indexed? Is it a short guidebook or a thousand-page graduate textbook? A software manual with a limited shelf life? Reference material? Fiction? (Yes, fiction is sometimes indexed.) A multivolume encyclopedia?</p>
<p><a id="pinpt33"/>How stable is the content? Is it fixed, as in a printed book? Will it be issued as a loose-leaf guide that is regularly updated? Does it appear in a constantly changing Web site? Is it material that will be used in multiple formats (such as in print and on CD)?</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p4" title="4"/>
<p><a id="pinpt34"/>The answers to these specific questions will inform the decisions that an editor and indexer must make about the indexing project. For example, multipurpose material may be produced using page-layout software, such as PageMaker or QuarkXPress, with embedded index tags, requiring the indexer to have available the appropriate matching software.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt35"/>Large indexing projects such as encyclopedias may take years and involve multiple indexers. In such cases, project management becomes especially important, as is coordinating and merging the material that individual indexers produce. Time for editing a multi-indexer project must be factored into the timeline, and, prior to starting, specific indexing guidelines must be developed to ensure a consistent approach.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt36"/>If millions of documents are being retrospectively indexed for inclusion in an enterprise-wide content management system, then you may need to develop a controlled vocabulary for use with an automatic indexing tool. Such projects can easily take several years from planning through implementation.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt37"/>A good editor will make sure the indexer understands the context, content, and user variables, ensuring that the finished index best serves its intended audience.</p>
</section>
<section title="Index Structure">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-6"><strong><a id="pinpt38"/>INDEX STRUCTURE</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt39"/>Indexes comprise two main parts: the index headnote and the entries themselves.</p>
<section title="Headnotes">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt40"/>Headnotes</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt41"/>Headnotes are used to alert readers to any unusual or nonstandard practices in the index. Headnotes may cover such items as use of special typography (&#x201C;Page numbers in italics refer to illustrations&#x201D;), abbreviations (&#x201C;In this index, VW refers to Virginia Woolf&#x201D;), or locator formatting (&#x201C;Locators are given in the format volume/issue:page&#x201D;). Headnotes may also indicate special issues of coverage (&#x201C;Names of fictional characters have not been indexed&#x201D;).</p>
<p><a id="pinpt42"/>Often in large or complex indexes, headnotes can be quite extensive. The headnote to the index volume for the <em>Diary of Samuel Pepys</em> (vol. XI, London: Bell &#x0026; Hyman, 1983) takes four and a half full pages. But that is not really overly long, considering the index itself spans 318 pages.</p>
</section>
<section title="Index Entries">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt43"/>Index Entries</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt44"/>Index entries consist of three parts: headings, subheadings, and locators.</p>
<section title="Headings">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt45"/>Headings</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt46"/>Headings are the terms that lead users to information. Headings typically consist of nouns or noun phrases; adjectives or adverbs rarely make useful headings. Headings should also express complete concepts and should provide access both to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p5" title="5"/>high-level topics as well as to more specific details. Thus, a book on political economy might have general headings such as these:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt47"/>developing countries</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt48"/>financial systems</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt49"/>global state economic governance institutions</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt50"/>markets</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pinpt51"/>as well as more specific headings such as:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt52"/>Medici bank</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt53"/>oil companies</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt54"/>self-regulating markets</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt55"/>Broad subject headings serve those who have not read the book by providing a good overview of its major topics, while specific headings are important for those seeking minor, but still significant, information of a precise nature.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt56"/>All headings should begin at the left margin and should use a lowercase initial letter, except for proper nouns. This makes names easier to find. However, some indexers argue that all headings should be capitalized, as they believe this makes the index easier for readers to scan.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt57"/>Headings should be arranged in alphabetical order or any other searchable order (e.g., numerical) appropriate for the type of material being indexed. It is important to note, however, that alphabetical sorting is not as simple as it first appears. There are two major systems for alphabetization: letter-by-letter and word-by-word. In letter-by-letter alphabetizing, spaces between words are ignored. Such alphabetizing is used in dictionaries and phone directories.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt58"/>The following two lists show the same terms, first alphabetized according to the letter-by-letter principle and then word-by-word. (In the latter case, alphabetizing stops at the space. If the first word is the same in several entries, then they are alphabetized by the second word, and so on.)</p>
<table class="table1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="td1a"><strong>Letter-by-Letter</strong></td>
<td class="td1a1"><strong>Word-by-Word</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1a">gas</td>
<td class="td1a1">gas</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1a">gas masks</td>
<td class="td1a1">gas masks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1a">gasoline</td>
<td class="td1a1">gas production</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1a">gas production</td>
<td class="td1a1">gas works</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1a">gastritis</td>
<td class="td1a1">gasoline</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td1a">gas works</td>
<td class="td1a1">gastritis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p6" title="6"/>
<p><a id="pinpt59"/>In general, word-by-word alphabetization tends to be easier for readers to understand, and it also allows for easier scanning of headings. However, publishers are probably split 50/50 between which method they prefer.</p>
</section>
<section title="Subheadings">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt60"/>Subheadings</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt61"/>Most of us have seen index entries such as this:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt62"/>Algeria, 90, 91, 101, 112, 113, 115, 116, 119, 126, 127, 177, 185, 195, 196, 200, 202, 214, 215, 250, 273, 285, 287, 315</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt63"/>Such entries do a disservice to the reader. No one is going to spend time looking at every single one of the pages in the hopes of finding the specific information being sought. What this type of entry needs is subheadings: additional words and phrases that <em>differentiate</em> the long string of locators, giving users specific information as to what falls on each of those pages. Subheadings should usually be written if you have more than five or six undifferentiated locators for a heading.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt64"/>As with headings, subheadings consist of nouns or noun phrases but may also be participial phrases. Subheadings are arranged in alphabetical order, using the same principle (word-by-word or letter-by-letter) used for headings:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt65"/>Algeria</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt66"/>cultural background, 91</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt67"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt68"/>foreign relations, 113</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt69"/>history, 90</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt70"/>major cities, 101</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt71"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt72"/>religious institutions, 112</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt73"/>&#x2026;</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt74"/>Here users can easily find the particular information they need. Obviously the use of subheadings takes more space than undifferentiated locators, but the added benefits to users strongly outweigh the additional cost incurred because of increased index length. Long strings of locators should be avoided&#x2014;they are generally a sign of deficient quality.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt75"/>One can mitigate somewhat the length that subheads add. In the previous example, the subheadings appear in <em>indented</em> format, with each subheading starting on a separate line. It is also possible to present subheadings in <em>run-in</em> or <em>paragraph</em> style. In this case, subheadings continue on the same line as the previous subheading, separated by semicolons:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p7" title="7"/><div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt76"/>Algeria, cultural background, 91; &#x2026;; foreign relations, 113; history, 90; major cities, 101; &#x2026;; religious institutions, 112; &#x2026;</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt77"/>This makes scanning the index more difficult but does save space while preserving the additional information that subheadings provide.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt78"/>Depending on the complexity of the material being indexed, additional levels of subheadings may be necessary:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt79"/>Meiji</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt80"/>early life</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt81"/>birthplace, 10</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt82"/>education, 12&#x2013;15</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt83"/>as emperor</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt84"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt85"/>political activity</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt86"/>This style often is preferred in legal or medical texts. In the previous example, special typography could be used to differentiate the various levels of subheadings, making it clearer for the index users where they are in the index:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt87"/>Meiji</p>
<p class="pqph2"><small><a id="pinpt88"/>EARLY LIFE</small></p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt89"/>birthplace, 10</p>
<p class="pqph3"><a id="pinpt90"/>education, 12&#x2013;15</p>
<p class="pqph2"><small><a id="pinpt91"/>AS EMPEROR</small></p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt92"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph2"><small><a id="pinpt93"/>POLITICAL ACTIVITY</small></p>
</div>
</section>
<section title="Locators">
<h3 class="level3"><strong><em><a id="pinpt94"/>Locators</em></strong></h3>
<p><a id="pinpt95"/>At the end of each heading or subheading, locators direct users to the place in the text where specific information may be found. In most cases, locators are page numbers, but they may be paragraph or section numbers, or even grid numbers (for maps). For Web indexes, the hypertext links serve as locators that take the user directly to the desired information.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt96"/>If the format of locators is complex, as often happens in journal or multivolume indexes, then the headnote should provide information explaining the formatting specifics, like volume or year.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt97"/>Locators are generally presented in numerical order for page numbers or in alphabetical order for locators that begin with letters. Locators are usually separated by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p8" title="8"/>commas or by some other character (like a semicolon) if commas are used within the complex locators:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt98"/>1996:III,29; 1997:VII,138; 1998:V,3</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt99"/>Most locators direct the reader to a specific page, and it is expected that readers will scan the entire page to find the referenced information. In large-format books, such as atlases or encyclopedias, a grid system or page quadrant system may be employed to provide users with faster access to the particular place on the page where information is located.</p>
<figure class="fig-img"><img src="images/Art_P2.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
<p><a id="pinpt100"/>Here, a large page uses the letters a, b, c, d to indicate quadrants. So index locators would take the form:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt101"/>[heading], 10a, 28d, 257b</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt102"/>Again, information in the headnote should explain this nonstandard usage.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Cross-References">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-7"><strong><a id="pinpt103"/>CROSS-REFERENCES</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt104"/>Cross-references in indexes provide a navigational structure that helps guide users from one place in the index to another. There are two types of cross-references in indexes.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt105"/>The first type is <em>see also</em> references, which direct users from their current place in the index to where they will find additional relevant information:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt106"/>bears, 49. <em>See also</em> black bears; brown bears; Polar bears</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p9" title="9"/>
<p><a id="pinpt107"/>In this case, the reader is being directed from information about bears in general to specific information about different types of bears.</p>
<p><em><a id="pinpt108"/>See also</em> references can also direct users to parallel or related information:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt109"/>pensions, 287. <em>See also</em> retirement</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pinpt110"/>or</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt111"/>paintings, 2, 317, 493. <em>See also</em> sculptures</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt112"/>Here, the reader is being directed to neither broader nor more specific information, but to closely related information that might be of interest.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt113"/>Another way in which indexes assist readers is by translating their terminology into that used in the text. A general audience would probably use the term &#x201C;cats&#x201D; when thinking of the animal that is a house pet. But a text for veterinarians might prefer the term &#x201C;felines.&#x201D; Without an appropriate cross-reference, users looking up &#x201C;cats&#x201D; in the index would not find any information. But there is important information for them in the text. So a <em>see</em> reference is created, which takes this form:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt114"/>cats. <em>See</em> felines</p>
</div>
<p><em><a id="pinpt115"/>See</em> references are especially useful in multi-author texts, where the different authors may use different terms for the same concept. Since it is important that all the information be collected in one place in the index, the indexer must choose a single term to represent the concept, with <em>see</em> references from all other terms used in the text to represent that concept:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt116"/>streetcars. <em>See</em> light-rail transport</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt117"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt118"/>trams. <em>See</em> light-rail transport</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt119"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt120"/>trolleys. <em>See</em> light-rail transport</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt121"/>In such cases, it is a helpful practice at the main entry to show users the alternate terms they may find in the text. So here the appropriate phrasing would be:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt122"/>light-rail transport (streetcars, trams, trolleys)</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt123"/>[lots of subheadings]</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p10" title="10"/>
<p><a id="pinpt124"/>This lets readers know that while the subject of light-rail transport is discussed in many places in the text, the words &#x201C;streetcars,&#x201D; &#x201C;trams,&#x201D; or &#x201C;trolleys&#x201D; might appear on any specific page, in addition to the phrase &#x201C;light-rail transport.&#x201D;</p>
