<section title="Index Length and Index Space" epub:type="bodymatter chapter">
<h1 class="chapter-number"><a id="pinpt1"/><a href="toc.xhtml#chap-5"><strong>Chapter 5</strong></a></h1>
<h1 class="chapter-title"><a id="pinpt2"/><a href="toc.xhtml#chap-5"><strong>Index Length and Index Space</strong></a></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt3"/>This chapter discusses two of the most important questions when dealing with indexes: knowing how long the index <em>should</em> be and reducing the size of an index (either by employing typographic means or actually reducing the length of the index) to fit the space available.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt4"/>The first section in this chapter covers the average or appropriate length of an index given the type of material it covers. The remainder of the chapter deals with the thorny question of reducing the size of an index. First, techniques to &#x201C;squeeze&#x201D; an existing index are discussed. Next, methods for appropriately cutting an index are covered.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt5"/>While there are a number of techniques that a professional indexer can use to reduce the size of an index, such cutting almost invariably reduces the usability of the index and makes specific information more difficult for the reader to find. So it behooves the editor to consider adding a signature to accommodate the index as it stands. Often tightening up the preliminary matter can save a page or two, which can then be allocated to the index.</p>
<section title="Average/Appropriate Index Lengths">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-24"><strong><a id="pinpt6"/>AVERAGE/APPROPRIATE INDEX LENGTHS</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt7"/>In <em>Indexing Books</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), Nancy Mulvany provides the following general guidelines for the length of an index:</p>
<table class="table2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tdb" ><strong>Type of Material</strong></td>
<td class="tdb"><p class="center"><strong>Length of Index<br/>Relative to Text</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdb">Mass market trade books</td>
<td class="tdb"><p class="center">2&#x2013;5&#x0025;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdb">General reference books</td>
<td class="tdb"><p class="center">7&#x2013;8&#x0025;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdb">Technical documentation</td>
<td class="tdb"><p class="center">10&#x0025;</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdb">Specialized technical material</td>
<td class="tdb"><p class="center">15&#x002B;&#x0025;</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><a id="pinpt8"/>The percentages represent the number of pages in the index relative to the number of pages in the text. Accordingly, a 250-page trade book should have an index in the range of 5&#x2013;12 pages, while a reference book of the same length (250 pages) should have an index of 17&#x2013;20 pages. The rising percentages in the chart reflect the increasing density of the material, requiring increasingly longer indexes.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p64" title="64"/>
<p><a id="pinpt9"/>Legal texts generally use a 5 percent figure for the size of their index. Scholarly material, because of its often dense arguments, benefits from an index that, like general references as noted in the previous table, is in the 7&#x2013;8 percent range.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt10"/>The length of the index is directly related to the number of entries the indexer is told to pick up:</p>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt11"/>Light indexing: 3 or fewer entries per page</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt12"/>Medium indexing (which most books get): 4&#x2013;6 entries per page</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt13"/>Heavy indexing: 7&#x2013;10 entries per page</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt14"/>Encyclopedic treatment: 10&#x002B; entries per page</li></ul>
<p><a id="pinpt15"/>The exhaustivity or depth of indexing should be appropriate for the material being indexed. Asking the indexer to work at 3 entries per page in dense scholarly material will do a disservice to both author and reader, as important topics will be left out of the index, making information finding inefficient, if not impossible.</p>
</section>
<section title="Reducing the Index Space">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-25"><strong><a id="pinpt16"/>REDUCING THE INDEX SPACE</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt17"/>One of the difficult tasks that an editor faces is having to reduce the size of a completed index to fit the space available. If the index is too long for the space, the first thing to consider is how much the size of the index needs to change. Reducing the index by only a few lines is significantly easier than cutting it to save one or more pages, and there are a number of space-saving techniques that can easily reduce the size of an index without cutting the index itself.</p>
<section title="Tactics for Minimal Space Reductions">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt18"/>Tactics for Minimal Space Reductions</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt19"/>If only a few lines need to be saved, then it may be possible to tighten up the index using one or more of these techniques:</p>
<ul class="ulindent" epub:type="list">
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt20"/>Modifying the letter spacing slightly to reduce the number of turnover lines</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt21"/>Closing up the space between individual alphabetical sections of the index</li>
<li class="litop"><a id="pinpt22"/>Eliminating section heading letters, if those have been used</li></ul>
<p><a id="pinpt23"/>There are a number of additional techniques that may be used to further reduce the space that an index takes without changing the length of the index itself.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p65" title="65"/>
</section>
<section title="Number of Columns">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt24"/>Number of Columns</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt25"/>Changing the number of columns used in the index can significantly impact the number of pages required. Changing from a single- to double-column display can save 25 percent or more space in a large index. The reduction in index size is based on the fact that index entries often contain short, single-line entries. Accordingly, two columns make it possible to accommodate two entries on a line as opposed to having a single entry on that line in a one-column format.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt26"/>A simple example illustrates this change:</p>

<p><a id="pinpt53"/>In the single-column format shown here, this index extract (from the <em>Columbia Companion to East Asian Literature,</em> 2003) takes 27 lines. In the two-column format that follows, the same extract takes 18 lines, a 33 percent space savings:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p66" title="66"/>
<figure class="left1"><img src="images/Art_8.jpg" alt="art" /></figure>
<p><a id="pinpt54"/>Larger page sizes than those of a standard 6 &#x00D7; 9 book can obviously accommodate more than two columns. Books sized in the 8&#x00BD; &#x00D7; 11 range generally use a minimum of three and sometimes four columns. Of course, in increasing the number of columns beyond two, the space savings is often offset by the additional number of turnover lines required because of the narrower column width.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt55"/>See <a href="chapter004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> for additional discussion of the number of columns used for an index.</p>
</section>
<section title="Typography Changes">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt56"/>Typography Changes</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt57"/>Most books typeset indexes two point sizes smaller than the text; it is rare for an index to be in the same size as the text. If necessary to accommodate an index longer than the space available, the index font size may be reduced even further.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt58"/>Certainly, consideration must be given to the age of the intended audience for the text when considering reducing font size. A book for seniors, for example, should rarely use a font size smaller than 12 point, even for the index. In general, a 1-point font-size reduction will result in an index shorter by about 10&#x2013;15 percent.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt59"/>It is also possible to reduce the amount of space an index takes by tightening letter spacing, which may reduce the number of turnover lines, or by reducing leading (line spacing). Both of these solutions, however, reduce readability, making the index harder to use and less inviting.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p67" title="67"/>
</section>
<section title="Indented vs. Paragraph Format">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt60"/>Indented vs. Paragraph Format</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt61"/><a href="chapter004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> thoroughly discusses the differences between indented and paragraph format. While indented index format is preferred for ease of readability, changing to a run-in format can reduce the index size by around 15 percent. Care should be taken when using run-in style, since it is difficult to use sub-subheadings and present them in a way that readers can understand.</p>
</section>
<section title="Page Number Contractions">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt62"/>Page Number Contractions</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt63"/><a href="chapter004.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> also covers ways to contract page ranges. If those contractions are applied to the entire index, you may save some space by reducing the number of turnover lines. You may also decide to use page conflation more liberally, changing &#x201C;11, 12, 13, 15&#x201D; to &#x201C;11&#x2013;15.&#x201D; Although this may affect usability somewhat, it is as easy to keep reading as it is to flip back and forth from the index to the text over and over again.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Reducing Index Length">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-26"><strong><a id="pinpt64"/>REDUCING INDEX LENGTH</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt65"/>It may be the case, however, that none of the methods discussed so far have served to sufficiently reduce the size of the index. In this case, the editor should ask the indexer to cut the index by a specified amount. Having the indexer do this will ensure that the overall structure of the index and the inter-entry relationships are maintained to the extent possible. An editor or author making changes willy-nilly can often cause cross-reference errors that indexers would be able to find and fix using their indexing software.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt66"/>The process of cutting an index is not a simple matter. Reducing the size of the index by one page can mean having to cut 100 entries; that can represent a significant proportion of the index. The cutting must be done with care and with a well defined plan in mind, and it takes a lot of work to do properly. The following techniques can be used when cutting the index is necessary.</p>
<section title="Number of Subheadings">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt67"/>Number of Subheadings</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt68"/>Generally, indexers use subheadings to differentiate strings of more than five locators. However, the number of undifferentiated locators may be increased to six or seven to control the size of the index. Keep in mind that this change makes it more difficult for the reader to find specific information, as he must now search all seven references for a given topic rather than finding descriptive subheadings.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt69"/>Depending on the number of headings this change affects, it can save considerable space when an entry contracts from:</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p68" title="68"/><div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt70"/>censorship (Japan)</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt71"/>during Allied occupation, 184&#x2013;185, 187, 222</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt72"/>of Hiratsuka Raich&#x00F4;, 96</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt73"/>laws on, 55</p>

<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt75"/>of Tanizaki Jun&#x2019;ichir&#x00F4;, 119</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pinpt76"/>to</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt77"/>censorship (Japan), 55, 56, 96, 119, 184&#x2013;185, 187, 222</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt78"/>Again, consideration must be given to the trade-off with index usability.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt79"/>What else might you cut? Names with only one page number or concepts that seem tangential to the main argument of the book may be left out. For entries with multiple subheadings, check to be sure that there is no over-analysis; it may be possible to combine several subheadings into a slightly more general one.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt80"/>Under a person&#x2019;s name, you might have the following entries:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt81"/>relationship with father, 27</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt82"/>relationship with sister, 15</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt83"/>relationship with wife, 92, 124</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt84"/>Those could easily be combined into one subheading:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt85"/>family relationships, 15, 27, 92, 124</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt86"/>Another example of over-analysis is a heading with multiple subheadings that all reference the same small page range:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt87"/>Arkansas</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt88"/>alcohol sales online in, 701, 702</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt89"/>sales tax on Internet purchases in, 699</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt90"/>tobacco sales online in, 700</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt91"/>That could easily be reduced to:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt92"/>Arkansas, 699&#x2013;702</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt93"/>Such ranges covering less than six pages are not a major hindrance to the reader and can help keep the index uncluttered. Subheadings, after all, do take extra <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p69" title="69"/>time to read and if they all refer to the same small page range, the reader has wasted time for little additional information.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt94"/>Finally, remove single subheadings, if any. Change:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt95"/>lace cookies</p>
<p class="pqph2"><a id="pinpt96"/>baking techniques, 11</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="pinpt97"/>to</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt98"/>lace cookies, 11</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt99"/>Alternately, combine the heading and subheading into a &#x201C;modified&#x201D; heading (for example, &#x201C;lace cookies, baking techniques, 11&#x201D;), although the additional line length may mean a turnover line, so you haven&#x2019;t actually saved any space.</p>
</section>
<section title="Cross-References">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt100"/>Cross-References</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt101"/>One of the significant benefits of a good index is that it provides alternate terms by which users can find a specific subject:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt102"/>Cancer. <em>See</em> Oncology</p>
</div>
<p><a id="pinpt103"/>If necessary, some or even all of these <em>see</em> references can be removed. Depending on the size and complexity of the index, this modification might save a page or two. However, the findability of specific topics is significantly reduced, since the user must now try to think of possible alternate terms herself if the information is not found under the first term she thinks of.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt104"/>Indexes also direct the reader to additional material that may possibly be relevant through the use of <em>see also</em> references. These, too, may be pruned to save space, although this action diminishes the index&#x2019;s usefulness.</p>
</section>
<section title="Double-Posts">
<h2 class="level2"><strong><a id="pinpt105"/>Double-Posts</strong></h2>
<p><a id="pinpt106"/>Indexers will place identical locators under two or more different headings, allowing users to find the information in whichever of those places they look:</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt107"/>baby chairs, 27, 38, 197</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt108"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt109"/>highchairs, 27, 38, 197</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt110"/>&#x2026;</p>
<p class="pqph1"><a id="pinpt111"/>infant chairs, 27, 38, 197</p>
</div><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="p70" title="70"/>
<p><a id="pinpt112"/>The duplicate entries may be removed to reduce the overall size of the index. However, think carefully about which term most of the book&#x2019;s audience is likely to look for.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section title="Increasing Index Length">
<h1 class="level1" id="h1-27"><strong><a id="pinpt113"/>INCREASING INDEX LENGTH</strong></h1>
<p><a id="pinpt114"/>In rare cases it may be necessary to increase the length of an index. Any of the typographic techniques mentioned earlier may be used. However, it is still necessary to keep in mind that a font size too large or lines spaced too far apart impair readability. So the changes should be moderate, if possible.</p>
<p><a id="pinpt115"/>In addition, the techniques for reducing an index length can be used in reverse: increasing the number of double-posts, adding (appropriate) cross-references, and reducing the number of undifferentiated locators. However, these require additional work by the indexer, so they should not be undertaken lightly, as they will require an additional (usually hourly) fee for the adjustments to be made.</p>
