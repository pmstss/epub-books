 Backward Compatibility</h2> <p class="calibre3">As described in the Linux chapter, all of the source for the entire software stack is publicly available so fixes can be made in the proper place. This is an important part of what makes free software simpler, more maintainable and more reliable over time.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The free software stack has traded simplicity for backward compatibility and so there is a downside. For example, Windows lets you download drivers off the web that will work on multiple versions of its OS, but Linux does not support this scenario because the internal kernel architecture is constantly changing. If hardware vendors did make Linux drivers available on the web, they would potentially have different drivers for every version of the kernel. The best way to get a new driver in Linux is to grab the latest kernel, which is where all the new drivers go.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is possible that if you buy a new piece of hardware, your old kernel might not have support for the new driver. What then?</p>
 <p class="calibre3">To be clear, this scenario is contrived in several ways:</p>
 <ul class="calibre21"><p class="calibre3">Anyone can add a driver to the Linux kernel, 	so the need to ever download code from a website is greatly reduced.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">The vast majority of the hardware you would 	buy in a store will have drivers that have been a part of the Linux 	kernel for several years. Even new hardware typically uses old 	drivers.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Linux ships more frequently, and the code is 	free, so it is less likely you will be running an old version of the 	Linux kernel.</p>
 </ul><p class="calibre3">This is not a problem that has ever bitten me, but it is theoretically possible given its development model. In this situation, it could be that the simplest way to get your new hardware to work is to install a new kernel. Unfortunately, most Linux distributions do not allow you to just update the kernel as you must upgrade the entire OS. This is a notable downside of today's Linux.<a name="sdfootnote102anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote102sym" id="sdfootnote102anc"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">However, this is a trade-off in the development process that favors simplicity, reflects the dynamic nature of software, and so the need to upgrade software periodically is a fact of life that needs to be accepted rather than resisted. The alternative is a backward compatibility quagmire that Microsoft wallows in.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There are other backward compatibility issues. OpenOffice's native format is OpenDocument, but you can't use it until all whom you might share documents with are also using that software. And even when the documents are converted to the new format, the files are often hardcoded with font names owned by Microsoft. Proprietary software's biggest “advantage” is its switching costs. Oracle's proprietary database is powerful, yet unwieldy and old, and application vendors who have spent thousands of hours writing Oracle-specific code, have also created a situation where moving to any other product, even something free, is expensive. Fortunately, these are one-time costs.</p>
