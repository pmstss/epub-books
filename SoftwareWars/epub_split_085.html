Metrics</h2> <i class="calibre5">One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Milton Friedman</i> <i class="calibre5">What's measured improves.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Peter Drucker</i> <p class="calibre3">Microsoft conducts yearly polls that give them statistically significant data on the state of the company. If they want to know whether developers were “happier” than they were five years before, they can get hard numbers on this. By gathering the right data and watching it over time, management can fix any organizational trends heading in the wrong direction.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">This data was collected and managed by the Human Resources Department, but every other Microsoft team had metrics as well, and by far the most important was the bug count. The Microsoft buglist almost isn't even considered a metric because it is the driving force in <span>the development process</span>.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> A lesson of success is the importance of metrics in driving change. Rudy Giuliani explained in his book <i class="calibre5">Leadership </i>that turning around New York City required a lot of hard work, but the key was to gather and publicize data about problems and track progress on them.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">People might argue that data is a bureaucratic waste of time and rightly point out that by itself it doesn't change anything. What they are missing is that it gives people information which serves as motivation. When kernel developers see that the median age of Linux's bugs is ten months, they will realize that they should do better. This will motivate them to spend a bit more time working on the older bugs.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Every software team needs to find metrics that give good analysis of the state of their product <span>over time. Metrics</span> also help potential users of a piece of software; just knowing the total number of users and developers provides an excellent way to analyze the health and success of a component. The other nice thing about such a metric is that it is a self-reinforcing feedback loop that causes the fastest growing teams to grow faster.</p>
