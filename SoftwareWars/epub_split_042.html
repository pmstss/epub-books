 Biotechnology Patents  </h2> <i class="calibre5">There are more than 50 proteins possibly involved in cancer that the company is not working on because the patent holders either would not allow it or were demanding unreasonable royalties.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —Peter Ringrose, Chief Scientific Officer, Bristol-Myers Squib</i> <p class="calibre3">  <img src="wordpress_html_m7c984ade.gif" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>Chart of the content in pharmaceutical TV ads</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Although this book is about software, it is worthwhile to look at patents for biotechnology. Michael Crichton recently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/opinion/13crichton.html?ex=1190088000&amp;en=c4e638c0f01d356c&amp;ei=5070"><span>argued</span></a>
 that because companies have been able to patent genes, that are <span>not even invented by man, </span>biotechnology research is threatened. Patenting drugs is one thing; patenting genes is something entirely different.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Against Intellectual Monopoly,</i> by Michele Boldrin and David K. Levine, is an interesting book that discusses many patent and copyright issues. It describes the case for removing patent protection for pharmaceutical companies that produce relatively simple chemicals requiring extensive research and testing. This is a brief summary of their arguments against patent protection for drugs:</p>
 <ul class="calibre21"><p class="calibre3">Before the pharmaceutical industry 	came along, the most important chemical industry was for paints and 	dyes. The authors' study of the history of those companies shows 	that companies in countries with patent protection had slower rates 	of innovation. One of the biggest reasons is because “the chemical 	industry is a classic case of innovation chains – new compounds 	and processes built on the knowledge of existing ones.” Patents, 	therefore, get in the way of this.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Countries such as Switzerland and Italy, 	which for many years didn't have patent protection on 	pharmaceuticals, still had robust industries. Adding patent 	protection has actually hurt investments in those countries' 	pharmaceutical industries.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Pharmaceutical companies spend 13% of 	revenues on R&amp;D and spend twice as much on marketing and 	promotion. The cost of R&amp;D is not such a big deal as the drug 	companies say it is.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Two-thirds of the money spent on 	pharmaceutical research in the United States comes from the 	government. This public money is getting turned into private 	patents.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Many drugs are inexpensive to produce, but 	drug companies do not make them available to poor countries. If they 	did, they could be re-imported, hurting their profits in the 	higher-priced Western markets. Furthermore, the fact that there are 	such large profits to be made in Western markets has discouraged the 	development and production of drugs to treat diseases plaguing the 	poor countries of Africa and Latin America.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">A study by the <span>U. 	S.</span> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 	(CDC) found that of the top ten public health achievements of the 	20<sup class="calibre7">th</sup> century in the United States, none was motivated by 	a desire to patent.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">The current patent system 	perverts pharmaceutical companies and makes them focus on copycat 	drugs. According to an article from <i class="calibre5">The New Republic</i>:</p>
 </ul><i class="calibre5"> Turn on your television and note which drugs are being marketed most aggressively. Ads for Celebrex may imply that it will enable arthritics to jump rope, but the drug actually relieves pain no better than basic ibuprofen; its principal supposed benefit is causing fewer ulcers, but the FDA recently rejected even that claim. Clarinex is a differently packaged version of Claritin, which is of questionable efficacy in the first place and is sold over the counter abroad for vastly less. Promoted as though it must be some sort of elixir, the ubiquitous “purple pill,” Nexium, is essentially AstraZeneca's old heartburn drug Prilosec with a minor chemical twist that allowed the company to extend its patent.</i> <ul class="calibre21"><p class="calibre3">Money spent on research 	and marketing of these me-too drugs is money not being efficiently 	allocated. From Boldrin and Levine:</p>
 </ul><i class="calibre5"> Monopolies innovate as little as possible and only when forced to; in general they would rather spend time seeking rents via political protection, while trying to sell, at a high price, their old refurbished products to  powerless consumers, via massive doses of advertising.</i> <ul class="calibre21"><p class="calibre3">The largest cost of making new drugs 	is clinical trials. In some cases this can cost $800 million, and in 	others $6.5 million. Many of the clinical trials are for me-too 	drugs, which are a waste. Furthermore, companies paying for clinical 	trials have a conflict of interest. Boldrin and Levine argue that 	clinical trials should be paid for by competitive NIH grants. The 	information about the effects of a drug is a public good and 	therefore should be paid for by the public.  	</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">There are three stages of clinical trials, 	and so the authors suggest drug companies pay for stage I, but that 	public money be used for stages II and III. Taking this cost away 	would allow the drug companies to focus more on fundamental R&amp;D. 	The biotechnology firms still have a long way to go in their 	understanding of chemistry and DNA.</p>
 </ul><p class="calibre3">Boldrin and Levine don't necessarily suggest that patents be eliminated; even shortening the period of protection would decrease the adverse affects of the above issues. Furthermore, even if we assume that lowering or removing patent protection will hurt investments, the government could give R&amp;D tax credits to offset the decrease. Finally, they argue that too many drugs are available by prescription only, which increases costs and lowers revenues for the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Congress, in mid-2007, was considering some patent reforms. Some of the changes included changing the patent system to grant them to the first one to file, not the first one to invent, and to limit the amount of infringement damages. Both of these ideas are bad, however, and are just nibbling around the edges. Boldrin and Levine argue that the following reforms should be considered:</span></p>
 <ul class="calibre21"><p class="calibre3"><span>Proof 	that you independently invented something should be a defense 	against a patent infringement.</span></p>
 	<p class="calibre3"><span>Licensing 	fees for patents should be set close to R&amp;D costs.</span></p>
 	<p class="calibre3"><span>Have 	the government fund clinical trials.</span></p>
 	<p class="calibre3"><span>Reduce 	the number of drugs requiring a prescription.</span></p>
 	<p class="calibre3"><span>Decrease 	the term of patents to four years.</span></p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Suspend<span> 	drug patents in poor countries. To prevent drug re-importation, 	suspend free trade for medicines.</span></p>
 </ul><p class="calibre3"><span>Boldrin and Levine argue that rather </span>than<span> allowing for the creation of patents, subsidizing a portion of R&amp;D via tax credits is a more efficient allocation of public resources.</span></p>
