 Digital Images</h2> <p class="calibre3">Unlike audio and video, in the realm of still images things are in good shape. JPEG is an efficient, free, and widely-supported standard for compression of images.<a name="sdfootnote103anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote103sym" id="sdfootnote103anc"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a>
 There might be a couple of standards better than JPEG out there, but the end is nigh. (There is a JPEG 2000 standard based on <span>wavelets</span><span><a name="sdfootnote104anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote104sym" id="sdfootnote104anc"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a>
</span> which is 20% better than JPEG, but it has higher memory and processing demands. Sometimes to get a little more compression, you have to do a lot more work, and so you reach a point of diminishing returns.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Microsoft in early 2007 announced a new Windows Media Photo format, which is also 20% better than JPEG, but without higher memory and processing demands like those required by JPEG 2000. The new format is based on JPEG, but with nine small tweaks. The spec is public, and there is even free public source code, but the license explicitly excludes it from being used in combination with copyleft licenses:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">2. c. Distribution Restrictions. You may not … modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or others have the right to modify it.</i> <p class="calibre3">Fortunately, reverse engineering is easily doable because the spec is public and if you start with existing JPEG code you are already very close — a tiny, hidden, speed bump Microsoft has created for the free software community.</p>
