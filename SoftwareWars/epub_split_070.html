 		Red Hat</h2> 	  <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_m1ff909a1.png" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>The first Linux distribution I used was Red Hat, the largest commercial Linux producer. One might conclude, therefore, that a big part of the reason Linux hasn't taken off with desktops is because Red Hat didn't really focus on building a user-friendly experience. Red Hat built a platform usable by Google but not by our moms. Instead, they focused on developers, servers, grid computing, the web, etc. For many years, certain basic user scenarios, like setting up a shared printer, have been cumbersome on Linux.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Red Hat's chief technology officer, Brian Stevens, was <a href="http://www.redhat.com/v/ogg/summit07_stevens.ogg"><span>recently asked</span></a>
, “When is Red Hat getting into the desktop space?” His response:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">To us, the desktop metaphor is dead. It's a dinosaur. Today's users aren't sitting at home, sitting at a desk in isolation anymore. They are collaborative. They are sharing. They work and play online. We don't believe that re-creating the Windows paradigm with just pure open source models does anything to advance the productivity or the lives of the users.</i> <p class="calibre3">Stevens is confusing the desktop as a personal and powerful tool <i class="calibre5"><span>with mass appeal</span></i>, with the desktop as a user interface metaphor! If they don't get what the desktop is, it should be no surprise that the Linux desktop hasn't taken off after 10 years of work. Furthermore, there is nothing wrong with the current desktop metaphors of windows, icons, and menus. These concepts <i class="calibre5">do</i> allow people to work and play online, and share documents over the Internet. We might come up with user interfaces like those out of science-fiction movies, but that isn't necessary, or sufficient for that matter, to enable the scenarios that Stevens describes.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Red Hat produces two versions of a Linux operating system: a free, community-oriented product known as Fedora, and a commercial version known as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which is typically purchased by corporations as part of a support contract.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The wisdom of this dual-market strategy is debatable because it separates the user base and the brand. Red Hat's enterprise product generates the most revenue, so this is where the company's focus lies. Unfortunately, few normal users run the enterprise product because it is rather expensive<a name="sdfootnote75anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote75sym" id="sdfootnote75anc"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a>
 and it ships every 18 months, which is a long time given the fast-moving state of free software.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Red Hat's concentration on its for-profit enterprise offerings has distracted it from creating a healthy community of interested geeks who could have contributed free improvements and additions to both versions.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is an open question as to how much revenue Red Hat would make if they chose not to charge for their enterprise version, but charged for support. Red Hat has been charging for their enterprise version for many years, and effectively bundling support for free, but in fact people typically buy RHEL because they want support, not because the software is significantly better than the community version. In fact, Red Hat could decide to sell support for both versions. These changes might even generate more revenue for them! With only two million RHEL customers today, the potential for growth is huge.</p>
