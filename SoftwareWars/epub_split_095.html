Digital Audio</h2> <p class="calibre3">It is the mess of proprietary standards and patent restrictions that are impeding the progress to digital audio. Proprietary software companies have been pushing their standards down our throat. If you insert a music CD into a Windows computer, it wants to rip the audio into WMA, a proprietary format which the Mac OS doesn't support out of the box. If you insert that CD into a Mac, it rips the music into AAC, a format that Windows doesn't support by default.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">I'm not sure what should be done about this colossal mess. We should keep trying to pick a standard format for audio, like JPEG has become for still images. The best candidates are OGG and MP3. MP3 is an old format and while it is not considered state of the art, it is efficient enough. MP3's primary problem is that there are a number of companies with patent claims against it. If the industry cannot agree to end the patent hassles, it should adopt OGG or some other fully free format and tell those MP3 license owners to take a long walk off a short pier.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If we could finally agree on a free digital music format, we could finally have digital music â€” which will also open up many possibilities of a richer connection between artist and consumer. Whatever format is chosen, we need to define the number of bits per second required to achieve transparency.<a name="sdfootnote105anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote105sym" id="sdfootnote105anc"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a>
 We also need to come up with a standard streaming protocol and video format, but I won't even get into that here; we must crawl before we can walk.</p>
