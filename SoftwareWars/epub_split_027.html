 		Is Copyleft a Requirement for Free Software?</h2> 	  <p class="calibre3">Richard Stallman's copyleft, the idea of ensuring that free science stays free, is one of the most unique concepts in the digital age. It is such a radical idea that it is not universally accepted, even within the free software community.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In fact, source code is considered free by today's software community if it supports the first three freedoms (run, study, copy), but not copyleft (make those enhancement freely available to all.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Two very popular free licenses, the MIT and BSD licenses, are considered free but simply say: “Please include this copyright message at the top of the source code.” You can use this code, copy it and study it, but you can also make it proprietary again. This sort of free software does not require anyone to contribute anything back if they enhance it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Stallman considers these lax licenses; while they sound reasonable and are strictly speaking, “more free” than copyleft, the problem is that this laxly protected software frequently becomes proprietary again. Keith Packard has told the story of how the Unix windowing system was initially created under a lax license, but was rewritten multiple times because it got hijacked and made proprietary multiple times. An enormous amount of programming work was wasted but because the codebase was not GPL right from the beginning.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">One of the reasons why Unix was never much competition for Windows is that many of its vendors did not work together. Linux's GPL license nudges people into working together to save money in total development costs and speed progress.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Some argue the lax licenses are “less scary” to organizations which don't understand or truly appreciate free software. This issue can be solved by better education of the computing community, not by encouraging license agreements for ignorant people. As Eben Moglen points out, things in public domain can be appropriated from in freedom-disrespecting ways. In general, once people understand that software is a science, the idea of enabling proprietary science will not be interesting. Further adoption of copyleft will increase the efficiency of the free software community and help it achieve world domination faster.</p>
