Let's Start Today</h2> <i class="calibre5">All economic activity is by definition “high risk.” And defending yesterday — that is, not innovating — is far more risky than making tomorrow.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Peter Drucker</i> <i class="calibre5">When there's a will to fail, obstacles can be found.</i> <i class="calibre5">—John McCarthy</i> <i class="calibre5">Sometimes the real hurdle to renewal is not a lack of options, but a lack of flexibility in resource allocation. All too often, legacy projects get richly funded year after year while new initiatives go begging. This, more than anything, is why companies regularly forfeit the future -- they over invest in “what is” at the expense of “what could be.”</i> <i class="calibre5">New projects are deemed “untested”, “risky”, or a “diversion of resources.” Thus while senior execs may happily fund a billion-dollar acquisition, someone a few levels down who attempts to “borrow” a half-dozen talented individuals for a new project, or carve a few thousand dollars out of a legacy budget, is likely to find the task on par with a dental extraction.  </i> <i class="calibre5">The resource allocation model is typically biased against new ideas, since it demands a level of certainty about volumes, costs, timelines, and profits that simply can't be satisfied when an ideal is truly novel. While it's easy to predict the returns on a project that is a linear extension of an existing business, the payback on an unconventional idea will be harder to calculate.  </i> <i class="calibre5">Managers running established businesses seldom have to defend the strategic risk they take when they pour good money into a slowly decaying business model, or overfund an activity that is already producing diminishing returns.  </i> <i class="calibre5">How do you accelerate the redeployment of resources from legacy programs to future-focused initiatives?</i> <i class="calibre5">—Gary Hamel, <i class="calibre5">The Future of Management</i></i> <p class="calibre3">When software, the most important building block of mankind's intellectual property, uses a standard GC programming language and protects itself with copyleft, mankind will enter a shining age. I think better runtimes are critical to the success of Linux on the desktop.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, fixing this problem is a big task because inertia is such a powerful force. The good news is that the difficulty of porting to a different language is not the same in every case. Porting from one modern language to another is ten times easier than moving from C to C#. Right now, much of our code and infrastructure lives in the dark ages, and this first port is the hardest, but it will provide big benefits.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">During my tenure at Microsoft, I witnessed numerous re-writes. Unfortunately, most of them failed. Those that failed had at least one thing in common: they usually were re-writing C code in C, or C++, and because they did not use significantly better tools as part of their plan, they never ended up saving any time in the end. It doesn't make sense to re-build something from scratch unless you plan to make it <i class="calibre5">a lot</i> better. But if the teams out there move from C or  C++ to a much more productive language, they will save time in the end and it is much more likely to succeed — assuming they start.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The key is to make a plan and break down the problem. For example, the OpenOffice word processor could use the existing layout engine written in C and replace the UI with one written in a GC language. This first step would give the team expertise to help them make the subsequent steps. They also might find that a bold vision will bring in new contributors, especially if it is easier and more enjoyable to work on the new codebase. Whatever choice makes sense for each team, the important teams like Firefox, OpenOffice, and Gnome should agree on a language because that will bring along the rest of the Linux desktop.</p>
