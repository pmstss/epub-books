 Linux is Inexorably Winning</h2> <p class="calibre3">The fact that the Linux kernel has these many advantages over Windows means two things. First, the argument that free software engineers are unable to innovate and only copy the work of others is not true.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The head of Windows Server recently <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1975848,00.asp"><span>said</span></a>
 that free software, “<span>by its very nature, does not allow intellectual property to be built.” This statement is </span>factually<span> incorrect: the </span>Linux kernel is doing many things no kernel has ever done before, just as Wikipedia is doing things no encyclopedia has ever done before.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Second, even if Microsoft gave away the source code to the Windows kernel, the existing <span>free </span>software community would dismiss it. A worldwide community has pounded Linux into the shape it should be. Linus calls Windows “witchcraft”, so why work on an inferior codebase whose details up till now have been opaque?</p>
