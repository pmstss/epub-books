Conclusion</h2> 	   	 		<i class="calibre5">We can only see a 		short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be 		done.</i> 	  <i class="calibre5">—Alan Turing, father of modern computer science</i> <i class="calibre5">Their policy on the problem of maintenance was but a game they seemed to be playing with a piece of rubber that could be stretched a little, then a little more.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Ayn Rand, <i class="calibre5">Atlas Shrugged</i></i> <p class="calibre3">Phew — thanks for making it through all that! I had to explain GC because the fact that it is missing from so much code is the biggest reason why programs crash and people don't trust computers today. When software, the most fundamental building block of mankind's 21<sup class="calibre7">st</sup> century intellectual activity, protect themselves with copyleft, and use a standard GC programming language, mankind will enter a shining age. Perhaps we only <span>need </span>free software, but I don't think we can ever get there with C/C++, which are missing an important piece of technology invented 50 years ago.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Software, like math, is a pure world. Any aliens who have invented software will have created the same Quicksort algorithm we have.</span> <span>One of my mentors at Microsoft, Eliyezer Kohen, designed</span><span><span> some of the best, and most complicated, code at Microsoft. He showed </span></span><span>that code should be written as carefully as a ma</span><span><span>thematician constructs a proof. The compiler, the operating system, and </span></span>everything<span><span> else is simply the external machinery created to run your perfect software. His thoroughness left a strong impression on me, but better tools make it easier to write and share code, no matter what language you use. In fact, with better languages and runtimes, you can make your code “perfect” faster.</span></span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span><span>If Microsoft were to move its important code to C# and the free software world were to fail to move their code away from C/C++, Microsoft could leave them in the dust. In general, the task of converting the free software codebases to better tools is much easier </span></span><span><span>than porting Microsoft's code because the free codebases are ten </span></span><span><span>years younger, and much smaller and simpler. In fact, Microsoft's codebases are so big and old that I'm not sure they could port them, </span></span><span><span>and if they did, they'd likely break backward compatibility so badly that users wouldn't necessarily switch to the new version. If they did </span></span><span><span>provide perfect </span></span>compatibility, they'd build something almost as complicated as what they have today, and they wouldn't be able to divorce themselves from 20 years of legacy.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Switching to modern tools could be a huge competitive advantage for the free software community. The tremendous inefficiency of the free software community is its greatest weakness, and tools play an enormous part of that, and is a big part of how millions of free software programmers can continue to lose to Microsoft's thousands.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Upgrading to modern tools is a task that few of the important teams in free software are even considering. Every free software group needs to create a five-year plan and start today. We must do this for reliability reasons, but we will receive many other benefits. What language should they choose? That is the subject of the next chapter.</p>
