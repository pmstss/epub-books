Mono and Python</h2> <p class="calibre3">Today, the most popular GC runtimes on the Linux desktop today are Mono and Python. Both are built by a worldwide community, but each has certain advantages and disadvantages.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">One of Mono's biggest advantages is that it is compiled. While performance is not the most important factor of software quality, any language which wants to become the standard for Linux needs a compiler. Even if only a small fraction of any piece of software is performance-critical, the language doesn't know what that part is, and so it should run all code fast. Another advantage of Mono is that it comes with a complete end-to-end solution for creating programs: a graphical editor and debugger, code browser with auto-complete, etc. With Python, you must piece together these components yourself, and there isn't a standard one with critical mass.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Mono's biggest disadvantage stems from the fact that it is an implementation of .Net which is a standard created by Microsoft. The C# language and the core libraries are not created with much input from the worldwide community and the enhancements are improved only on Microsoft's schedule. Microsoft has hired some of the best language designers on the planet, like Anders Hejlsberg, but he is not as smart as the combined knowledge of the rest of the languages designers on the planet. This has practical effects: C# added “dynamic language” features in the version 4.0 of the language, while Python has had these for many years.<a name="sdfootnote71anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote71sym" id="sdfootnote71anc"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Another “disadvantage” of Mono is that there is an enormous amount of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) that surrounds it. Microsoft has historically been hostile towards free software, calling it a “cancer” and sometimes threatening to sue over claimed patent infringements, and while this should create fear all over the free software stack, it appears to be directed mostly at Mono! I believe Linux programmers are being irrational because the .Net specification is publicly available, and Microsoft has repeatedly promised not to sue for implementations of it. Programmers should also realize that Mono extends the reach of .Net to other processors and operating systems, which benefits Microsoft's customers.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Python's advantage is that it is created with input from programmers all over the world, and has a larger set of libraries than any other GC language:</p>

The Python community has quietly created a wide variety of libraries for everything from gaming to scientific computing. There are even books to teach it to 8-year olds.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Python's biggest disadvantage is performance: it is not compiled and doesn't support multiple threads. These features are a requirement for any serious runtime and so one might wonder whether Python is still at a prototype phase of development. Even fans of Python very loudly complain that while it might be suitable for little scripts and application plugins, it is too slow for writing large applications.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">These features are a big amount of work that are not even on Python's to-do list. And as the language has never been compiled there are even some questions as to whether it can be made fast.<a name="sdfootnote72anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote72sym" id="sdfootnote72anc"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a>
 In addition, Because the Python runtime is slow, the developers are forced to write a lot of support code in C, which further slows its development progress. Is is a shame that Python isn't fully using a tool which would have made their job easier — their own language. There are efforts such as the PyPy project which has built a Python compiler, in Python, which outputs C. Unfortunately, this piece of elegance is not yet the mainline codebase and is not considered for such.<a name="sdfootnote73anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote73sym" id="sdfootnote73anc"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a>
 And as mentioned earlier, the language doesn't have a standard graphical programming and debugging environment. So Python today has impediments for both casual programmers looking for an easy way to get into programming, and professionals who care about building high-performance applications.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There are other interesting languages and runtimes out there, but I believe the Linux desktop community should focus on these two. Mono already supports other languages in addition to C#, some that even look like Python.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There are many good programming languages, in fact there are too many, but I also think they a number are good enough. One could further tweak the letter of the English language to make it easier for your eyes to distinguish the letters, and simplify the pronunciation rules, but it isn't necessary because what we have is good enough. Likewise, it is much more important to build a complete set of libraries for all aspects of computing, a Wikipedia of free code, than to worry that further language innovation is the gating factor towards any future progress in software. Paul Graham and others view programming languages as a continuum of richness and elegance, but that isn't really true; Lisp is still considered one of the best programming languages, in spite of its age, so we must reach a point of diminishing returns. In general, the way you extend a programming language is with new functions.</p>
