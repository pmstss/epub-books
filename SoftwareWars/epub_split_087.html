 Must PC vendors ship Linux?</h2> <p class="calibre3">Many argue that hardware companies need to start shipping computers with Linux pre-installed before Linux will take off. While this is helpful, it is not necessary, and not sufficient.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The best first step for the hardware vendors would be to ensure that all of their hardware components have drivers in the Linux kernel tree. Once this has happened, it will mean that, in <span>general, every distribution of Linux will run on every model of their machines. In many cases, different models use many of the same components, so </span>supporting<span> the 20</span><sup class="calibre7"><span>th</span></sup><span> machine is often no more work than supporting the 19</span><sup class="calibre7"><span>th</span></sup><span>.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Once the drivers are in the kernel tree, there is n</span>o <span><span>need </span></span>for a hardware vendor to pre-install Linux because the user can do it themselves. Windows is installed by hardware manufacturers because the retail version is missing drivers, but this need not be the case with Linux. (In fact, if your hardware is supported, installing Linux takes less than an hour.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Eric Raymond, in his recent essay “World Domination 201”, argues that the free software community should only purchase PCs from vendors that ship Linux. However, it is much simpler just to convince hardware vendors to support Linux than to create new multinational corporations.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Even if vendors don't provide support for Linux yet, they could make sure it runs. Again, while people might debate whether free software is good for software companies, it is inarguably a benefit for hardware companies because it lowers the cost of a computer. In fact, PC hardware vendors don't even need to do any work other than demand Linux drivers from <i class="calibre5">their</i> component vendors. The power easily lies within the PC hardware vendors to apply the necessary pressure.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Shipping computers with Linux is not sufficient for world domination because hardware vendors don't have the means to solve some of Linux's problems. Dell cannot ensure that Apple's iTunes works on Linux, or that OpenOffice can read your Publisher files.</span></p>
