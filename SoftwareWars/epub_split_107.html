US v. Microsoft</h2> <i class="calibre5">The political principle that underlies the market mechanism is unanimity. In an ideal free market resting on private property, no individual can coerce any other, all cooperation is voluntary, all parties to such cooperation benefit or they need not participate. There are no values, no “social” responsibilities in any sense other than the values and responsibilities of individuals. Society is a collection of individuals and of the various groups they voluntarily form.</i> <i class="calibre5">If an exchange between two parties is voluntary, it will not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it. Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can only gain at the expense of another.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Milton Friedman</i> <p class="calibre3">Microsoft got its tush handed to it in the DOJ trial, but that was because it lost credibility. For example, Bill Gates argued that he wasn't worried about Netscape. If so, why did Microsoft VIPs say they wanted to “smother” Netscape and “cut off their air supply”? Judge Jackson wrote that Microsoft's witnesses in the trial: “proved, time and time again, to be inaccurate, misleading, evasive, and transparently false.” However, what they say at a trial has nothing to do with how they behaved in the marketplace.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Fisher, the government's economist argued that it was “a joke” that Windows was challenged by the Macintosh or Linux. With just a few years hindsight, and the tremendous potential of free software, it becomes very clear that their economist was wrong. Furthermore, in the trial he admitted that he could find no specific harm that Microsoft had done. Microsoft might be a hard-charging competitor, but the software they wrote has been invaluable to the world, and they provided it at a cost much lower than many of their competitors like Sun, IBM and Oracle.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In addition to the Mac and Linux, the web was and is a huge threat to Microsoft — the PC development community used to revolve around Windows apps, but now it is all about web apps.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The government's major argument was that bundling a web browser into the operating system was illegal. However, including a browser with an operating system is a good idea for consumers. Without a web browser, you wouldn't be able to surf the web or send e-mail. Piecing together an operating system as a jumble of parts is a lot of work and should not be done by the end user. Every operating system today includes a web browser. If the government had its way, progress in Microsoft's software would be frozen with early 1990's technology.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Furthermore, the government never had a clear proposed remedy. The trial court's plan was to split Microsoft up into Windows, Office, and other parts, which would have been an unprecedented intrusion into a private company, and yet wouldn't have decreased the popularity of Windows or Office.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The fawning and shallow press focused more on David Boies brilliance and ability to quote obscure legislation from memory than the important facts and issues of the case he was making. Almost everything Microsoft did was done by other people in the industry. It was only because Microsoft became the biggest company on the block that it became illegal. Microsoft was a monopoly, and therefore was behaving badly, even when it was acting the same as everyone else. And, no one could describe when Microsoft had crossed that line.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Microsoft succeeded because it built the best products. That Sun, Netscape, Apple and other companies, who at the time were just as proprietary as Microsoft, complained is disingenuous. They were jealous and afraid, and used the government to help them. As Richard Stallman points out, all proprietary technologies are monopolies; Microsoft was just the most popular one.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Free software, better programming languages, standard formats, and the Internet have long been a threat to Microsoft, it just has not caused Microsoft's revenue to decrease, yet. Milton Friedman wrote that the only kind of monopoly that is a problem is a “coercive monopoly” which are created by government. In this case, there is no need to take an offending company to trial, but to remove the government regulation which created the monopoly in the first place. It would have been interesting if Microsoft would have made <i class="calibre5">only </i>this argument, and then rested.</p>
