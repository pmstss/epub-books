Pride of Ownership</h2> <p class="calibre3">While much free software is not paid for or organized by a company, the quality of it is just as good because the programmers do so with the same pride as they do a day job.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">When I joined Microsoft, I casually signed away the right to use my work anywhere else. Despite the fact that I no longer owned my work, and would never see the code again after I left the company, I didn't treat it with any less importance. It is in the nature of man to do his best whether or not he exclusively owns an idea.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In fact, unpaid volunteer programmers might be more tempted to do it right because there <i class="calibre5">isn't</i> a deadline. A lot of lesser-known free software in use today was started purely for the enjoyment of the programmer. Linus wrote Linux to learn about his computer, and even today, <a href="http://cycle-gap.blogspot.com/2008/07/linux-kernel-development-stats-from.html"><span>25% of contributors</span></a>
 to the kernel do not work for a company.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A programmer might have a boring job building websites — something that pays the bills, but writing fun code in his free time might provide more of a personal reward. There is a free physics engine used in video games called Open Dynamic Engine maintained by a PhD in his free time, while he works for Google during the day. Gcompris <span>is </span>a free educational program created by Bruno Coudoin for his two children.<a name="sdfootnote29anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote29sym" id="sdfootnote29anc"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a>
 He didn't need to make it perfect, because other programmers who recently became fathers showed up to help!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In proprietary software, the pride motivation to do the right thing is actually one step removed because you write software in the hope that you can ship it and sell it. And that urge to get it out there may encourage you to cut corners.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In a free software environment, you write code because there is a need – an itch to scratch. This encourages you not to overbuild something that is of no use to you like the Microsoft Office paperclip character.</p>
