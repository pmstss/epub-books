 Microsoft's Responses to Free Software</h2> <h3 class="calibre9">1. Windows + Office = $3</h3> <i class="calibre5">It’s easier for our software to compete with Linux when there’s piracy than when there’s not.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Bill Gates</i> <p class="calibre3">One of Microsoft's responses to free software has been to lower prices. Microsoft has created student and community editions of certain products that were low in cost but also often crippled. Microsoft also announced a bundle, available to qualifying third-world countries, that includes a low-end Windows, a low-end Office, and a few other items for just $3. There are fewer than one billion people with PCs, and so presumably a cheap bundle will make it easier for the remaining five billion people to get PCs. For potential customers there are several things wrong with this approach:</p>
  	<p class="calibre3">A Linux OS comes with a much larger set of 	applications than is included this bundle.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">The source code is not available, so 	engineers in these emerging markets cannot build up a service 	industry of companies who support and customize this software.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">Customers become locked into Microsoft file 	formats and other proprietary technologies, and the countries become 	dependent on Microsoft for future progress.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">The prices of the rest of Microsoft's 	software, from servers to developments tools, have not been lowered. 	This three-dollar bundle only gives users access to a small fraction 	of Microsoft's technologies.</p>
  <p class="calibre3">Of course the $3 bundle is a very smart defensive move by Microsoft. It is charitable of them to lower their price, however, the move might be considered “dumping,” which Wikipedia defines as an “act of a manufacturer in one country exporting a product to another country at a price that is either below the price it charges in its home market or is below its costs of production.”</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The low-cost bundle is a danger to the free software movement. I can think of nothing better than having millions of programmers around the world build their industrial base around a free license. Emerging markets should start off their economies on the right foot with software that's completely free.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If it weren't for piracy, Linux would have likely taken over the world already. I have been told that more than 90% of users in China run pirated software, and as no one can truly know, it could very well be closer to 99%. If it weren't for these illegal copies, China would have been forced to develop a suitable free software stack. And once something existed for a country such as China, it would have been usable for the rest of the world as well.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The United States needs to move rapidly towards free software if it is to be relevant in building the future. The U.S. invented the transistor, but it has also spawned a ton of old, proprietary systems that are a drag on future productivity. America is the widespread purveyor of non-free software which means the transition to free software will be much more difficult than for other countries which don't have this baggage.</p>
 <h3 class="calibre9">2. CodePlex</h3> <p class="calibre3">Microsoft has also created a number of websites where developers can use free code and collaborate, and the latest is called CodePlex. While it does demonstrate that Microsoft understands the benefits of free software, this website mostly contains tiny add-ons to proprietary Microsoft products. CodePlex may serve mostly to kill off Microsoft's community of partners who previously sold add-ons to Visual Basic and other products. While these serve as a bulwark against the free software movement and provide a way for Microsoft to claim that they get this new way of developing software, it ultimately undermines their business.</p>
 <h3 class="calibre9">3. Interop</h3> <p class="calibre3">Another way Microsoft has responded to requests for increased openness is by publishing specifications for certain file formats and protocols. While a spec is a document, and a promise not to sue, it still requires code, or reverse-engineering in order to put this idea to use on a computer. A spec attached to proprietary software is a spec with a huge cost attached to it: the cost to build the free baseline implementation.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Someone who wants to improve the C# programming language doesn't want to start with the spec, but with a compiler for that language. In fact, the spec could be <span>generated from </span>the compiler's source code.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Likewise, the best way to make sure that a new audio format becomes available on every device is to make freely available the code to read and write it. If the <span>details </span>are public, why not make them useful to a computer?</p>
 <h3 class="calibre9">4. Shared Source</h3> <p class="calibre3">Microsoft has also released some software under various “shared source” licenses. One of the first products Microsoft released under this license was C# and a portion of the .Net runtime. The language spec was always free, and there was a decision made to release some of the code as well in 2002. In addition to releasing the code, Microsoft seeded research efforts by sponsoring 80 projects in universities around the world. However, there is little activity today, and one reason is that the license is very restrictive:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">You may not use or distribute this Software or any derivative works in any form for commercial purposes. Examples of commercial purposes would be <i class="calibre5">running business operations</i>, licensing, leasing, or selling the Software, or distributing the Software for use with commercial products.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Microsoft Shared Source CLI License</i> <p class="calibre3">This is a license that shuns capitalism.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There is a free project managed by Novell called Mono which has reverse-engineered the C# runtime and libraries from the public spec. It has gained interest in a number of communities, and this runtime, not Microsoft's, provides a way to run C# code on the Mac and Linux. This free implementation could eventually become <span>the </span>de facto one<span>!</span></p>
