 Should all Software be GPL?</h2> <i class="calibre5">The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to a close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.</i> <i class="calibre5">â€”Winston Churchill</i> <p class="calibre3">I don't envision a world where all software need be free, but I do believe that all the world's large, interesting software projects require a collaborative effort and should therefore be built by a community and protected by a copyleft license.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There is a lot of generic mass in the lower layers of software. Eventually as you move up the stack, you reach areas that are specific to a particular business. At this point the importance of cooperation decreases, but it is also something which isn't even useful to competitors. In other words, whether in the lower or upper layers, all software may as well be free.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is still the early days in the coming gold rush era of free software, and those who understand this fact first will gain all the users, and get all the help. While Linux has locked in its spot, most of the rest of the free software stack isn't in this position yet, although many, like Firefox and OpenOffice, are close.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">One other relevant point is that, the sooner the free software community is brought in, the better off the codebase will be. There are a number of products that started out non-free and were only given to the community much later. By this time, one usually finds that the codebase is a complicated mess, and it takes a while for the community to understand it and clean things up. Mozilla's Firefox and IBM's Eclipse Java IDE are examples of products that took a while to take off after being liberated.</p>
