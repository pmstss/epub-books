 Software is a fast-moving industry</h2> <p class="calibre3">In the drug industry, it takes years of clinical trials to prove a medicine. The Tufts Center For the Study of Drug Development reported recently that the average time to get approvals for drugs was 6 years. The current patent length of 17 years is an eternity for the fast-moving field of computing. In his letter to the Patent Office, software scientist Knuth also wrote:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">Software patents will have the effect of freezing progress at essentially its current level. If present trends continue, the only recourse available to the majority of America's brilliant software developers will be to give up software or to emigrate.</i> <p class="calibre3">Therefore, even if you believe in software patents, shrinking their length of exclusive ownership to just a few years would be a compromise. Decreasing the duration of protection would also decrease the number of spurious patents, which would make it easier to be in compliance with all of those that are out there.</p>
