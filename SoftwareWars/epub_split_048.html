Music versus Drivers</h2> <p class="calibre3">Compared to the sociological need to protect music and movies, hardware manufacturers in the computing industry are on weaker footing when it comes to “protecting” the intellectual property of the software drivers for their hardware. Drivers are simply the minimal glue that allows their hardware to work with the rest of a system.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> Copyright laws were created to stimulate progress, but proprietary drivers serve as an impediment. Rather, they make people hate their computer, dreading the day of work necessary to install a fresh operating system. When you go to the store and purchase a $500 video card, you would like that hardware to work with your computer right out of the box. Given the time to design, manufacture and distribute hardware, software drivers should be available first. There is no reason to have to download any drivers when setting up a new computer using Linux. (Linux often has drivers available before the hardware is released.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">While most drivers for Linux today are free, the graphics card vendors are the most notable holdouts. They look at all the other smaller drivers and argue that their complex software has more worth. Of course, their current “worth” is a mixed bag because proprietary drivers not part of the free software tree are, by definition, out-of-date and incompatible. Linux is working hard to make a 3-D desktop, but it didn't run on an old computer because the proprietary driver didn't support the necessary features.<a name="sdfootnote35anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote35sym" id="sdfootnote35anc"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Good driver support could be a competitive advantage for a hardware company, and Intel is aggressively moving into the 3-D video card space with free drivers. However, it is best for the industry to have the hardware guys fight it out on hardware features and cost, not on software licensing agreements. (An important reminder here is that much of the funding for the Linux kernel comes from hardware companies. Linux and the rest of the free software movement is not being built only by volunteers.)</p>
