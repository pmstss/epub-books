Length of Copyright</h2> <p class="calibre3">Our Founding Fathers had it right, once again, when they determined that authors and inventors should have exclusive rights to their creations for “limited times.” Their thinking suggests a presumption that ideas will eventually flow into the public domain because, at some point, increasing the years of protection isn't guaranteed to promote further progress; instead, it may serve as an impediment.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">When copyright was first created in the <span>U. S.</span>, the term was 14 years, renewable once if the author was still alive. Today, the time frame that has been chosen for U.S. copyright law is the life of the author plus 70 years. This value was extended from the life of the author plus 50 years in 1998. (In Eldred v. Ashcroft, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this law. The way to fix copyright law is via Congress, not via the courts.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is hard to believe that people are motivated to make music so that they can sell it after they are dead, so one could say that this value is not “limited times.” Shortening the copyright law perhaps decreases the motivation to create things, but it also allows more people to have access to things they would never have otherwise. We need a new compromise and having a copyright term of 10 years should be the starting point for discussion. (In engineering, back of the envelope estimates are a good basis for analysis. If 10 years is too short, then next try 20, 40 and 80 years.)  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">Do you still buy 80s music? 90s music? How many of your movies, music and books were less than ten years old when you purchased them? I do not own any Beatles albums and I would never buy one even if money were burning a whole in my pocket. The only way I will hear Beatles music is if I can listen to it for free. I'll bet that most things purchased at Amazon were produced in the last ten years. Amazon could provide useful data to Congress on these points; the writers of the Constitution didn't define copyright length because they didn't have such data available to them.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">When the term of copyright expires, it does not mean that no one will sell the newly public domain item anymore. In fact, companies might be willing to make CDs and DVDs of things in the public domain for prices close to the marginal costs, yet still make a profit.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If you set the term of copyright beyond the point of drop off in sales, you will not have materially hurt the artists, but you will have created a richer world; the benefit of a free culture is that the next generation of budding artists will have so much greater access to art and they will become better artists for it.</p>
