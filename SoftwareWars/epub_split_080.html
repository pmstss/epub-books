Cash 		Donations</h2> 	  <i class="calibre5">It is every man’s obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Albert Einstein</i> <p class="calibre3">Drupal is a piece of free elegance to help manage the content of a web site. Like many software projects, it has a link where you can donate money via PayPal. While Drupal had 45,000 users in 2006, it received only $1,000 in donations, for an average donation of 2 pennies per person. Free software, as Eric Raymond says, is about scratching an itch — fixing a problem that you care about. But what if you have the itch and some money but not the ability to scratch it? The fact that much free software can flourish without money is amazing, but free software should have financial donations as a sustaining element, in addition to time.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Bounties, a collection of a large amount of money set aside towards a specific purpose, is another great idea that the free software community has explored but not widely adopted. If the eight million users of Ubuntu gave their one dollar towards bounties, and the bounties were set at $5,000 each, this would create enough money for 1,600 projects. A major effort of Linux distributors could be to gather proposals, take donations from interested users, and manage the development. Doing this would motivate free software users to donate money because it would be applied directly towards projects users care about.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is still early in the free software movement. The Linux kernel has thousands of contributors, but many other teams are not as well funded yet. An OpenOffice developer told me that this is the breakdown of developers from various companies:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">Sun: 30<br class="calibre4"/>Novell: 15<br class="calibre4"/>RedHat: 1 to 2<br class="calibre4"/>Ubuntu: ~1</i> <i class="calibre5">There are also RedFlag &amp; IBM with large numbers of supposed<br class="calibre4"/>contributors, but sadly with a large imaginary component ;-)</i> <p class="calibre3">The people at Sun who are responsible for OpenOffice do not realize its importance to put such few developers on it. In spite of the fact that Sun has over 30,000 employees, Microsoft has twice as many programmers working on Internet Explorer as Sun has working on all of OpenOffice! I wouldn't work on something as big and complicated as OpenOffice without getting paid, which is why I donated money.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">We are used to paying hundreds of dollars for proprietary software applications, and so we should be willing to invest smaller amounts for free software. I went on a guided tour of Mt. Saint Helens, and at the end the Forest Service Guide said that if you liked the tour, you should donate $5, but if you didn't, you should donate $20 — so they could improve the tour. That should be the attitude of the free software community: if you want more, contribute more. The nice thing about this model is that people can donate what they can afford. If you're a student or a business in India, the amount you can donate back for use of a free database is much less than if you are Amazon corporation and you have a farm of servers running the same software.</p>
