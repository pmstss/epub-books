 Volunteers Leading Volunteers</h2> <i class="calibre5">A manager's task is to make the strengths of people effective and their weakness irrelevant.</i> <i class="calibre5">A manager sets objectives—A manager organizes—A manager motivates and communicates—A manager, by establishing yardsticks, measures—A manager develops people.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Peter Drucker</i> <p class="calibre3">Many of Debian's leaders were grad students hanging out in academia. One might wonder if someone working part-time can effectively lead thousands of people, but if you add up all the time corporate managers spend courting customers, creating budgets, and attending the required training on Corporate Values, one might find that very few spend a significant portion of their time thinking about the long-term big issues. It is very easy to get caught up in the day-to-day.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Because everything in volunteer organizations like Debians run on autopilot, the leader has the opportunity to focus on the big problems and be effective, even while working part-time. However, leading volunteers is a task as difficult as herding cats as you must coax each of them to do something.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There are benefits to a flat command structure: people are forced to convince others to do something based on the merits of their ideas. Because decisions are made on their merit, issues generally resolve themselves, with the person doing the work making the ultimate decision in a Do-ocracy. Everyone wants to do their best, and if they don't write correct code, bugs will come in, and developers will be forced to confront their mistakes.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In addition to metrics, task forces are a great tool of leadership. With small teams it is easier to get a consensus and produce a coherent document describing a problem and the proposed solution. Coming up with a proposal is easier than implementing it, but it can serve as a rallying point.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">For example, Debian uses a lot of different tools to manage the history of the source code, with the number of tools increasing as Debian has grown. A task force could determine the recommended source control system. Such a recommendation wouldn't immediately change all the source control systems out there, but it would serve as a good default choice in the future, and it would push Debian, and the rest of the community, towards unification. Each task force needs to establish credibility and validity on its own to convince others in the loosely distributed meritocracy that is the free software movement.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">This book does not go much into specifics of how to create and foster a healthy community around a piece of free software. However, many of the keys to success are embodied in old-school books such as Dale Carnegie's 1936 classic, <i class="calibre5">How to Win Friend and Influence People</i>. For a more thorough treatment of this topic, I recommend Jono Bacon's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Community-Building-Participation-Practice/dp/0596156715"><i class="calibre5">Art of Community</i></a>
