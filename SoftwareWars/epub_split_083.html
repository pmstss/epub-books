PC Hardware</h2> <i class="calibre5">We love Linux, and we're doing our best to support the Linux community. we see the Linux desktop as a customer-driven activity. If customers want it, well, Dell will give it to them.</i> <i class="calibre5">â€”<a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS3822185143.html"><span>Michael Dell</span></a>
</i> <p class="calibre3">Michael Dell's quote demonstrates that he doesn't consider the situation where people aren't running Linux on his hardware because it doesn't work! I have a Dell Vostro laptop that doesn't have a Linux driver for wireless Internet. If I can't take the computer to a coffee shop and surf the web, it is useless. I've thought about putting a bullet through the laptop and mailing it back. Even laptops by Dell that ship with Linux still contain proprietary drivers, drivers that aren't in the kernel, and so forth so it seems clear that Dell management doesn't understand Linux yet. Dell also inexplicably has 30 models of laptops, each with 30 options, so it might just be a general case of corporate cranial-rectal inversion.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Overall, PC hardware support in Linux is generally in good shape, and has improved a lot in the years since I first started using it. I believe it mostly requires that we continue to press on, working through the chicken and egg issue where hardware vendors are reluctant to support Linux until it has more users, but users won't run Linux if it doesn't fully support their hardware.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">I singled out IBM in the OS chapter, but many other hardware companies are under-investing in free software even though public statements by their VIPs suggest that they believe in it. For example, Intel claims to be a strong support of Linux, but is doing only a decent job in its support of Linux drivers.<a name="sdfootnote95anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote95sym" id="sdfootnote95anc"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a>
 An Intel engineer told me at a Linux conference that their Linux efforts are just 1% of the manpower that their Windows efforts receive. Doubling their Linux development team would <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1838267,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594"><span>cost </span></a>
less than .1% of their total R&amp;D. Intel is under-investing in Linux not because they can't afford to increase costs by .1%, but because they're suffering from Stockholm syndrome!<a name="sdfootnote96anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote96sym" id="sdfootnote96anc"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If Linux could recognize all of your hardware, all of your free software would run; if there is a bug anywhere in your hardware or device drivers, then it is quite possible that <i class="calibre5">no</i> software will run. Therefore, step one of World Domination by Linux is World Installation. The software incompatibilities will be better solved as soon as the hardware compatibilities become better solved. Therefore, it is the kernel that is currently holding up the PC revolution.<a name="sdfootnote97anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote97sym" id="sdfootnote97anc"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">I've installed Linux on a number of computers and found several problems: the fingerprint reader and other optional hardware often doesn't work, the computer doesn't always come out of sleep, sometimes the modem drivers aren't available, etc. None of my particular problems were a barrier, but others aren't so lucky. I recently tried to upgrade my dad's eMachines computer from Ubuntu 6.06 to 8.10 but the install failed because of APIC incompatibilities.<a name="sdfootnote98anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote98sym" id="sdfootnote98anc"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a>
 There are <span>many </span>long discussion <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=361237"><span>threads</span></a>
 on the Internet about Linux hardware incompatibilities.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Linus has overseen the design of an incredible platform, with support for more hardware than any other OS ever, and his kernel is the best piece of large free code ever written, but it needs further work. One of the biggest challenges I see for the kernel development community is a lack of respect for their buglist, the most important metric describing the state of the kernel.</p>
