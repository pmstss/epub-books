 Sun locked up the design</h2> <p class="calibre3">When it created Java, Sun didn't want to release the code because they were worried people would take their code, tweak it slightly to better meet their needs, and create incompatibilities that would hurt the “brand” of Java — confusing a 99% friend with an enemy. This paranoia occurred because Sun made a rookie mistake in not understanding that a language needs to be extensible.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In the C and C++ world, there is even a convention that any non-standard keywords would be prefaced with two underscores, like this: “__inline”. In some cases, a feature started out as a vendor-specific addition, was adopted by others, and eventually became added to the language in an official way. The creators of C and C++ didn't have the hubris to believe they had built a perfect language.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Even more importantly, the primary way to extend a computer language is by creating new functions and data types, which was also not allowed in any of the domains specified by Sun.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Sun got it backwards — people will only make minimal changes necessary to Java to make it work for them. That is what happened in C and C++. Sun didn't have faith in its customers and didn't understand the realities of how large bodies of systems-level code are created.</p>
