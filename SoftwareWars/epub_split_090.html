Monoculture</h2> <p class="calibre3">Next to the problem of code written in old programming languages, the second biggest challenge the free software community faces is the amount of duplicate code that exists. There are several dictionaries in Linux, and so when you add a custom word to one, only some applications notice it. In Linux there are too many paint programs, media players, download managers, RSS readers, programming environments, source control systems, etc. Each piece of duplicate code is a missed opportunity for sharing and slows progress. On the other hand, the free software community has gotten together on primarily one kernel, Linux, and one web server, Apache.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There is an interesting debate in the software community about the worry of a software monoculture. Like a monoculture in the biological world, one virus or other problem could destroy the entire ecosystem, and some argue that we run similar risks in the software world.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">While a monoculture may be a risk, having different codebases doesn't necessarily help: any new, <span>previously unforeseen exploit </span>is able to cause damage to all codebases because none of them designed for it. A castle's walls may stop men, but they were not designed to stop cannonballs or helicopters.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">While the little differences between codebases add an extra level of variability that makes building a virus harder, software is different from DNA (today at least!) because of our ability to infinitely recombine it. It is possible to make a product easy to use, and powerful, rich and reliable, fast and maintainable. Because software is infinitely malleable, all the best ideas can be incorporated into a single product.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">In fact, the monoculture risk only applies to the proprietary software world because in that model we are unable to infinitely recombine ideas. There are hundreds of millions of Windows users, but there are only a few thousand people at Microsoft who can make changes to it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If the monoculture risk doesn't apply to the free software world, we should focus more on working together. Progress in the free software world is slow where people are not working on the same codebases. As described in the tools chapter, switching to modern tools will bring a 2x productivity improvement, and consolidating various efforts into unified codebases will bring an additional 5x productivity jump. Unfortunately, agreeing to unified efforts is <span>a much harder challenge because </span>each group needs to reach out to other groups, and be willing to combine their efforts and potentially abandon their existing software investments.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">SourceForge.net has 1.9 million programmers, but when you divide by 50 because they are volunteers, and then divide by 10  because of old tools and duplicate code, our 1.9 million-man army has only 3,800 people. <span>However, it is </span>amazing what free software has built when you realize that today it is on just a (relatively) small number of PCs. Even with that tiny user base, and their inefficiencies, they still have had the resources to do everything they have done. When you add to the 10x productivity improvement another 5x increase in users and contributors, free software in five years could have what seems like 50 times as many programmers as they do today.</p>
