 Openness in Health Care</h2> <p class="calibre3"><span>Throughout this book, I advocate cooperation in the future </span>development<span> of software. While doing research for this book, I came across a report by the Committee for Economic Development (CED), an </span>independent<span>, non-profit, non-partisan think tank that wrote a report </span>entitled: “<a href="http://www.ced.org/docs/report/report_healthcare2007dcc.pdf"><span>Harnessing Openness to Transform American Health Care</span></a>
”. According to the report:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">$2 Trillion dollars, 16-17% of our GDP, is spent on health care overuse, underuse, misuse, duplication, system failure, unnecessary repetition, poor communications and inefficiency.<br class="calibre4"/>The U.S. employer-based health care system is failing. Health care costs are rising faster than wages, quality of care is low, and access to coverage is deteriorating.</i> <p class="calibre3">The report details ways in which better cooperation can improve healthcare. For instance: The search for the human genome sequence was a competitive race. Celera, a private-sector firm, sought to be first to establish the sequence while, as was the norm, keeping much of its data private, to be made available on commercial terms to other researchers.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In contrast, the publicly funded Human Genome Project (HGP) followed an open model making its data publicly available and welcoming input from around the world. HGP pushed participating researchers to disclose their findings as quickly as possible. While Celera made important contributions to the sequencing, it was the HGP’s model of discovery that has transformed the research process by reducing “transaction costs and secrecy that may impede follow-on research.”</p>
 <i class="calibre5"> The HGP researchers not only put raw sequencing data into the public domain, but as the data were being produced, an open-source software program known as the distributed annotation system (DAS) was set up to facilitate collaborative improvement and annotation of the genome. This allowed any researcher to choose the annotation they wanted to view and enabled the ranking of annotations by the number of researchers that used them, something akin to Google’s methods for ranking search results.</i> <i class="calibre5"> This open model is now being used in a federally funded international effort to create a map of haplotypes (HapMap) which describes variations in the human genome that tend to occur together in “neighborhoods” or haplotypes. Data about the genotype of the individual haplotypes is being released publicly as soon as it is indentified. The openness of the HapMap effort is reinforced by its use of a licensing system that is “self-consciously modeled on the copyleft system of open-source software licensing” and which prevents those who utilize the data from attempting to close it to others via patents.</i> <i class="calibre5"> Utilizing the results of the HapMap process, a public-private partnership, the SNP Consortium, is identifying panels of a few hundred thousand single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can be used to identify common variants in an individual’s entire 3-billion base-pair genome that might be associated with a disease. As with the HapMap project, participants in the consortium have agreed to put the data they produce in to the public domain.  </i> <i class="calibre5"> In the reasonably near future, according to Dr. Francis Collins, leader of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the HapMap should help make practical case-controlled studies using SNP’s to identify gene variants that “contribute to diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer disease, common cancers, mental illness, hypertension, asthma, and a host of other common disorders.” That future seems nearer than ever today with scientists finding correlations between diseases such as multiple sclerosis and breast cancer and specific genetic variations.</i> <p class="calibre3">To harness the power of openness to speed the development of medicines and vaccines for less lucrative commercial markets, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation now conditions its grants to require researchers to share their results promptly so that others can build on successes, avoid pitfalls, and eliminate redundancy. It appears that Bill believes in openness for medical research, but not for software yet.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The CED reports concludes:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">Openness is ultimately about an attitude that sees the opportunity for many to benefit from greater access to information, as well as to contribute much to the benefit of us all. Greater openness is likely to become increasingly important in more and more areas driven by the relentless progress of information and communications technology. We offer these recommendations with the hope that modest changes based on greater access to information by more people, and more possibilities for them to contribute based on their own expertise and energy, can help improve health care in the United States and around the world.</i> <p class="calibre3">Currently, a lot of bioinformatics software is proprietary, following the current path of PC software, but that is likewise slowing progress.</p>
