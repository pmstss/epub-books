 MS's Support of Standards</h2> <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_m7f22dd81.gif" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>The shapes of the Latin alphabet are mostly happenstance. Many details in this world do not matter, it is only that we agree to them.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Microsoft had a mixed attitude towards standards. It played a key role in the creation of many, such as: HTTP, HTML &amp; XML, USB, ACPI, Unicode, and TrueType, and also supported standards it didn't play a part in creating, like TCP, SSL, SQL and SMTP.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">However, in many cases, Microsoft had a strategy to create a competing standard, and wasn't particularly interested in documenting its technologies into open standards. Before HTML and HTTP took off, Microsoft had an effort, code-named Blackbird, which contained many web-like features, but all elements were specified in a Microsoft-only world. Microsoft eventually canned Blackbird but, for a time, it was a much bigger deal inside the company than Internet Explorer, which started off as a <span>skunkworks </span>project based on the acquisition of third-party code. In most cases, Microsoft supported standards only when it felt commercial pressure to do so; one of the mottoes in the early days was that Microsoft: “sets the standard.”</p>
 <p class="calibre3">So many of the company's engineers wrote code all day long on market-leading products that working with competitors to standardize arbitrary details seemed pointless. The protocol to share files and printers between computers went undocumented for many years; what would be the point when it was never a priority to get it working on Mac and Unix? Proprietary protocols are a special type of bad standard because they tie you to two pieces of someone's technology. Microsoft's Outlook uses a proprietary protocol to fetch e-mail from Exchange; this protocol ties you to client and server.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The free software guys do not, and should not, have any compunction about implementing closed, undocumented or poorly documented standards, as long as the standard is popular. An open standard is always better, but it is the source code that is the true value of intellectual property, not whether the details are sanctioned by a particular <span>organization. </span> </p>
 <p class="calibre3">Free software supports more standards than proprietary software. If a standard is popular, it will get implemented. Linux by default rips music into the free OGG, but it is easy to change it. The Linux media player supports Microsoft's and Apple's media formats, plus free standards. Linux's instant messaging applet supports MSN, Yahoo, AIM, ICQ, GroupWise, Jabber, and others. In fact, proprietary software is holding up the development and adoption of new standards. The BBC has created a free wavelet-based video codec known as Dirac, but only Linux supports it out of the box today.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Since it is built by users who add features as necessary, free software gives you more choices than any proprietary vendor can motivate themselves to provide. Not only is there better support for standards, but also you will never be locked into a corner because support for a standard disappeared for “strategic” reasons. With open formats and free software, you are building a future-proof platform.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The web is the most important standard for information exchange, but one that is almost as important is the standard for office documents.</p>
