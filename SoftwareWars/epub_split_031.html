 		Where Does Vision Fit In?</h2> 	  <i class="calibre5">Ideas are somewhat like babies – they are born small, immature, and shapeless. They are promise rather than fulfillment. In the innovative company executives do not say, “This is a damn-fool idea.” Instead they ask, “What would be needed to make this embryonic, half-baked, foolish idea into something that makes sense, that is an opportunity for us?”</i> <i class="calibre5">—Peter Drucker</i> <p class="calibre3">In a world of free software where there is no strong leadership from the top, where does vision fit in? The answer is that there is vision in the big, and vision in the small. Vision in the big is when someone has an idea for a new project, describes this vision to others, creates a proof of concept, and an environment that encourages people to join the project. However, these new, big efforts like Wikipedia and the Linux kernel are very infrequently launched.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In actuality, on a daily basis, team members struggle to refine a product to make it better achieve that original vision. This refining activity requires lots of little work items with each step requiring a tiny bit of visionary insight moving the product forward in support of that big idea. In creating free products that anyone can contribute to, progress toward big visionary efforts will happen faster.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Note, free software doesn't imply that obstacles like ego and stubbornness will disappear, but it is also no different than what exists everywhere else.</p>
