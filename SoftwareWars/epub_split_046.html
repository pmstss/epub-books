Fair Use</h2> <p class="calibre3">The fair use clause of copyright allows you to use copyrighted materials for limited purposes without getting permission. This right was recognized by the courts in common law and was incorporated into <span>U. S.</span> Copyright law in 1976:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">The fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or prerecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall includeâ€”</i>  	<i class="calibre5">the purpose and 	character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial 	nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</i> 	<i class="calibre5">the nature of the 	copyrighted work;</i> 	<i class="calibre5">the amount and 	substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted 	work as a whole; and</i> 	<i class="calibre5">the effect of the use 	upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work.</i>  <p class="calibre3">There are questions unanswered here. Am I allowed to: make a mix-CD and give it to ten of my friends? Let people download it via the Internet? Sell it for shipping and handling plus $1?</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The biggest problem with fair use is that it is biased against the commercial domain. Fair use was not meant to take money out of art which reuses other art, but it has had that unintended consequence.<a name="sdfootnote32anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote32sym" id="sdfootnote32anc"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a>
