 IBM</h2> <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_m3732f1bb.jpg" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>“Prodigy”, a powerful ad describing the power of free software, created by IBM in 2003. Given IBM's tepid support for free software in 2008, their management should watch this ad a few more times.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">IBM was the first, and is still the biggest computer company, and has built many operating systems over the decades. However, it has yet to exhibit an interest in producing a Linux distribution for PCs. In fact, you cannot get Linux pre-installed on any of their computers today, even though IBM/Lenovo laptops are extremely popular in the Linux community. It is possible they gave up hope after their antitrust lawsuit in the 1970s, the distraction of mainframes and minicomputers, and the expensive and humiliating defeat of OS/2 by Windows in the early 1990s.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">IBM has touted its support of free software and Linux for eight years, but has done <span>very l</span>ittle to even ensure its hardware runs smoothly on Linux. I met an Intel employee whose job was to write device drivers for IBM hardware because IBM wasn't working on the problem. On my IBM laptop, the system generally works, but a number of the devices do not have Linux support.<a name="sdfootnote74anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote74sym" id="sdfootnote74anc"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a>
 IBM could have easily done the work, or just put a little pressure on its suppliers to get <span>them </span>to write the drivers. If you can design hardware, you can easily write the corresponding drivers!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In general, various people have labored to make IBM's hardware work for the important user scenarios. But if I un-dock my DVD-player on my IBM laptop, Linux will hang. This sort of dynamic functionality isn't needed, as one can just swap out parts when the computer is off. This code is tricky, the work is boring, and it is not necessary, thus the last bits like this have been left out. It is the sort of code that will not become functional until IBM understands free software can achieve world domination if only they'd lend a hand!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In addition to the above issues, IBM has made chunks of their code free, but still left a fair amount proprietary. For example, random products like Notes, Rational and Websphere have long been sold to enterprises. I wouldn't run those old dogs on my computer at any price, which is why IBM might feel that if they've got suckers who are willing to continue to pay for it, then they should just continue to take their money!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, there still must surely be a divide inside the company on the utility of free software. IBM has purchased the rights to some code and made them free, but often the codebases are ungainly (Eclipse developer tool) or irrelevant (Cloudscape database). The complacency of IBM and others toward Linux and free software contributes significantly to the continuing dominance of proprietary software.</p>
