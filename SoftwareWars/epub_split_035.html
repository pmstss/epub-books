Just 		a Stab</h2> 	  <p class="calibre3">Richard Stallman, who started the free software movement in 1985, might be right when he says that the freer intellectual property is, the better off society is.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">However, I don't think this should automatically apply to everything, even software. Furthermore, it is a choice for every creator to make. While it might make economic and moral sense for some ideas to be given away, that doesn't mean ideas are no longer owned. The GPL says that software is owned by its users.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Stallman reminds us that the concept of a free market is an idea that has taken a long time for the general public to understand and free software and the other intellectual property issues we grapple with today will also take time for society to grasp.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Computer pundit Tim O'Reilly makes the point that the GPL could become irrelevant in the coming cloud computing world. Nowadays, people focus on free code running on their own computer, but what about if you are using GPL code which is doing work on your behalf, but running on another processor? Currently, the GPL does not consider this scenario, but I think this is a loophole not within the spirit of copyleft. Perhaps this will be the battle for GPL v4, some years hence.</span></p>
