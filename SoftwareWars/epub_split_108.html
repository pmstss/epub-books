 		Microsoft as a GPL Software Company</h2> 	  <i class="calibre5">Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Niels Bohr</i> <i class="calibre5">In most  organizations, change comes in only two flavors: trivial and traumatic. Review the history of the average organization and you’ll discover long periods of incremental fiddling punctuated by occasional bouts of frantic, crisis-driven change.</i> <i class="calibre5">—<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/management/2009/09/29/what-really-kills-great-companies-inertia/">Gary Hamel</a>
</i> <p class="calibre3">I wrote this book under the assumption that if Microsoft continues on its current path and never adopts copyleft licenses for its code, what Wikipedia did to Encarta will likewise happen to Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, SQL Server, Visual Studio, Exchange, MSN, etc.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A tiny fraction of the software Microsoft produces runs on Linux, so Linux world domination means the end of Microsoft as we know it. Free software will force Microsoft to choose between licensing revenue and relevance.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A lot of people that I meet in the software industry hate Microsoft, but have valued its leadership. Many people recognize that Office is more polished than OpenOffice and pioneered many innovations. Internet Explorer was universally recognized for a significant period of time as a better browser than Netscape's. Microsoft's SQL Server is considered easier to use than Oracle's. Word beat Ami Pro and WordPerfect in the reviews.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Let us presume that Microsoft were to embrace the proposition that free software software is a good idea. There would be no reason to call Microsoft “evil” anymore, because copyleft would prevent it. When something is free, no one can control or monopolize it anymore. In adopting free software, they would have two possibilities available to it, however, both involve a dramatic change in what their employees do, and a significant drop in revenue.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Microsoft could release all of its code as GPL, learn to build this software as a globally distributed effort, and compete and better interoperate with other existing free software. I think this would be a mistake because Microsoft's codebases are too old, much bigger and more complicated than existing free software codebases, and the details today are not understood by the existing globally distributed software community.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If Microsoft were to release its code as GPL it isn't clear if the existing free software community would switch, and would create confusion and further fragmentation, an inefficiency which is already a huge problem. Therefore I will say little more about this possibility.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Even more dramatic is for Microsoft to adopt Linux and other free software. Microsoft could easily become the dominant Linux player. Mark Shuttleworth invested only a few million dollars to create Ubuntu and become the most popular Linux distribution, so imagine what Microsoft's billions and army could do? Microsoft could even develop mechanisms to make it easy for people and enterprises to move from Windows to Linux, a challenge they are uniquely able to tackle.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">This transition would involve a complete upheaval of the codebase almost every Microsoft employee works on, and would require they find an alternate source of revenue for their most profitable products. But they would likely find a way to employ all their existing engineers and using just their cash on hand, they could hire every one of their engineers for 5 years; in other words, they would have many years to sort out the revenue situation during the transition.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">As there is no free vision recognition, speech, or search engine with any critical mass, Microsoft could lead those efforts and lead the future even more dominantly than it owns the present! With the rest of the world helping out, the value of these offerings would be much greater than the proprietary set that Microsoft is currently offering today.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">One way Microsoft could jumpstart this transformation would be to purchase Novell or Ubuntu, or just by hiring Debian developers to help seed their existing teams and to cross-pollinate the culture. In early-2008, Novell's market capitalization was $2.2 billion, a mere 5% of the value of their recent acquisition target Yahoo!, and this is the most expensive way to jumpstart work on Linux.<a name="sdfootnote120anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote120sym" id="sdfootnote120anc"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">My one concern about this idea is that after criticizing Microsoft for: building a kernel inferior to Linux, for shipping too infrequently, for not building software with the same reliability that Boeing builds into their airplanes, for not sufficiently embracing standards, for being crippled by backward compatibility that maybe it wouldn't work out that well. Furthermore, I made a switch to zero Microsoft code smoothly and I believe the rest of the world can as well. Therefore if Microsoft made many mistakes, and we don't need them, should we entrust the future to them?</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> <span>However, if Microsoft were to embrace the GPL, better tools, shipping more frequently, having one tree the world can collaborate in to evolve more smoothly, and with a greater emphasis on open standards created in parallel with code, their next stack would be a lot better than their current one.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">These changes would allow Microsoft to not necessarily accumulate the baggage they've acquired in their current software, but I would just like to repeat that the most common reason why code is not reliable is that it is too complicated.<a name="sdfootnote121anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote121sym" id="sdfootnote121anc"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a>
 Whether that complexity is caused by backward compatibility, tools, Intelligent Design, shipping infrequently, too much of a focus on performance rather than code cleanliness, age, or the number of customers, I cannot say, but it is a problem that the rest of the free software community should learn from. Complexity is not only the enemy of reliability, it is the enemy of progress.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">This is idle speculation if Microsoft does not adopt free software.</p>
