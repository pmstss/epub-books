 Sun obsessed over specs</h2> <i class="calibre5"> A “spec” is close to useless. I have <i class="calibre5">never </i>seen a spec that was both big enough to be useful <i class="calibre5">and </i>accurate.</i> <i class="calibre5"> And I have seen <i class="calibre5">lots </i>of total crap work that was based on specs. It's <i class="calibre5">the </i>single worst way to write software, because it by definition means that the software was written to match theory, not reality.</i> <i class="calibre5"> So there's two MAJOR reasons to avoid specs:  </i>  	<i class="calibre5"> 	They're dangerously wrong. Reality is different, and anybody who 	thinks specs matter over reality should get out of kernel 	programming NOW. When reality and specs clash, the spec has zero 	meaning. Zilch. Nada. None. <br class="calibre4"/>It's like real science: if you have 	a theory that doesn't match experiments, it doesn't matter <i class="calibre5">how 	</i>much you like that theory. It's wrong. You can use it as an 	approximation, but you MUST keep in mind that it's an approximation.</i> 	<i class="calibre5"> 	Specs have an inevitable tendency to try to introduce abstractions 	levels and wording and documentation policies that make sense for a 	written spec. Trying to implement actual code off the spec leads to 	the code looking and working like CRAP.</i>  <i class="calibre5"> The classic example of this is the OSI network model protocols. Classic spec-design, which had absolutely <i class="calibre5">zero</i> relevance for the real world. We still talk about the seven layers model, because it's a convenient model for <i class="calibre5">discussion</i>, but that has absolutely zero to do with any real-life software engineering. In other words, it's a way to <i class="calibre5">talk </i>about things, not to implement them.</i> <i class="calibre5"> And that's important. Specs are a basis for <i class="calibre5">talking about</i> things. But they are <i class="calibre5">not </i>a basis for implementing software.</i> <i class="calibre5"> So please don't bother talking about specs. Real standards grow up <i class="calibre5">despite </i>specs, not thanks to them.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Linus Torvalds</i> <p class="calibre3">Imagine designing a car by a committee on a computer, and then sending the design directly to the assembly line without building a car first and letting anyone test-drive it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Sun didn't let anyone read or tinker with their code but they wanted to be <span>seen as </span>a community-oriented effort, so, they created the Java Community Process where human-readable specifications describing Java were produced. Unfortunately, they focused on the specs and not on releasing software for people to try out so that the feedback came years later, or not at all. The biggest feedback that Sun would have received, but did not, was how insanely complicated their Java specs were. As an example, here is what a menu item looks like on the screen:</p>

 <p class="calibre3">The list of functions the Swing Java MenuItem class implements, with bizarro names like “isFocusTraversalPolicyProvider” and “addVetoableChangeListener”. Imagine if you needed to become familiar with 456 things to use your oven.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Such bloated code is hard to understand and even harder to make reliable. And this is just <span>the Swing class library's </span>opinion of a menu item, one of three popular implementations of Java widgets, and supposedly an efficient one!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Java is plagued by too much complexity as you can see, and releasing specs instead of code is a big cause of this problem. In fact, many of the Java specs aren't widely used because they do not meet developers' needs, or they became heavily amended after they finally got into customers' hands, which was often years after the specs were originally written.<a name="sdfootnote66anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote66sym" id="sdfootnote66anc"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Java was not growing carefully and organically, as Linux has done, by following the “ship early, ship often” methodology. A lot of people who hate Java do so because of its pervasive extraneous complexity.</p>
