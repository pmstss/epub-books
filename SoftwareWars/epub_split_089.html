<span>Approachability</span></h2> <i class="calibre5">The adversary she found herself forced to fight was not worth matching or beating; it was not a superior ability which she would have found honor in challenging; it was ineptitude — a gray spread of cotton that deemed soft and shapeless, that could offer no resistance to anything or anybody, yet managed to be a barrier in her way. She stood, disarmed, before the riddle of what made this possible. She could find no answer.  </i> <i class="calibre5">—<span>Ayn Rand, </span><i class="calibre5">Atlas Shrugged</i></i> <p class="calibre3"><span>I believe the free software community ought to focus on a fully functioning out of the box (OOB) experience. </span>People need to be able to take a Linux CD, stick it into a new, or old, computer, have it recognize the hardware, install everything, and migrate the data. A key to Linux's success, and to the success of computers, is that it should work with minimal user input.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Installing Windows, as many people know, can take a full day.<a name="sdfootnote101anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote101sym" id="sdfootnote101anc"><sup class="calibre7">8</sup></a>
 To beat Windows, Linux will have to do better. Fortunately, even with all of its warts, Linux isn't that far off. I wrote a post on my blog in April, 2006 entitled “10,000 Bugs Away from World Domination.” In it, I wrote that if we could fix about 10,000 selected bugs in the free software stack (50 man-years of work, compared to Vista that had 5,000 man-years of effort), we could come very close to building an operating system that someone as computer unsavvy as my mom could install and maintain. Right now, setting up Linux can take ten steps, but any issue you run into is likely to be arcane to fix.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Even if we never get there for everyone, we can definitely get closer than we are now which is important because fixing computer problems is never easy, even on Windows. In fact, a perk of Microsoft VIPs was that they had personal IT staff for computer setup and maintenance! With their established IT infrastructures, large businesses should be able to move to Linux today, even with its warts.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In general, while the Linux kernel has a few remaining challenges, the biggest challenge for the next five years will be for the rest of the free software stack to get up to the same level of quality as the kernel. While Firefox and OpenOffice are rich and quite stable, few would argue that these popular and important applications, or any other free software for that matter, has the quality, reliability and elegance of the Linux kernel.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In some ways, applications are harder to build because unlike a hardware driver, which is by definition concrete and fully specified, a web browser and a word processor are applications whose full requirements are unknown and unlimited. What should a web browser do while disconnected? If speech recognition becomes the de facto input method, how does this change the user interface of a word processor? These are questions to which answers are elusive.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In the tools chapter, I discussed how modern tools will build more reliable applications, but the important point here is that better tools will make developers more productive, which will allow software to evolve more quickly as we better figure out the answers to some very hard questions.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is important that free software programs, and their codebases, be approachable. Wikipedia's motto: “Don't bite the newcomers” is a great one for every free software organization. A big challenge for the next few years is to make the entire free software stack easier to use and more approachable for new users and programmers.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Many wonder whether Linux needs a killer application to beat Windows. Linux's status today of being mostly compatible with, and slightly more reliable than Windows might <i class="calibre5">not</i> be enough to overcome the inertia required for a worldwide switch, even to something that is free to acquire.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">It is true that if Linux were to enable robust continuous speech recognition, or some other transformational feature, Linux could more quickly take over, but even that OS would also need to support all your hardware and file formats as well. However, Linux already has what I think is a killer feature: the rich set of programs that come with it — although they could still use a bit more work. For example, the most popular high-end graphics editor in Linux, poorly named the “GIMP”, is comparable to Photoshop, suitable for professionals, and free! However, <span>like</span><i class="calibre5"> </i><span>Photoshop,</span> it isn't particularly approachable for a new person to jump in and start using. The first time you use GIMP, it might take 20 minutes to figure out how to crop an image. It takes time to learn any powerful tool, but a lesson in engineering is: “You only pay for what you use.” Simple things should be simple to do, and today this is not always the case. While many of the free applications are good enough to convert people from Windows, and as good as competing proprietary products, they could still be dramatically better.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">While the free software community is already doing good business, especially for websites and embedded applications, PC hardware and software are the biggest and final challenge. The minimal requirements, the Web and Office, are almost met today, yet its true potential, its Wikipedia-scale potential, is something much larger and several years of work away.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Once we start to coalesce into a few very good codebases, then the PhDs will be motivated to jump in. Nowadays, a graphics researcher might use GIMP to manipulate images, but he would definitely not use GIMP's source code as the basis for his research. <span>Eventually computer scientists around the world will instinctively realize the place to contribute is in the free software code, </span>just as there are linguists and computer scientists today using Wikipedia as the basis for their research. Once the PhDs get involved, software will get very interesting.</p>
