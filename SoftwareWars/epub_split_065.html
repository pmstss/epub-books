 Pouring Java down the drain</h2> <i class="calibre5">The Lord said, “If as one people speaking one language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.”</i> <i class="calibre5">Genesis 11:6<a name="sdfootnote70anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote70sym" id="sdfootnote70anc"><sup class="calibre7">6</sup></a>

 <p class="calibre3">Sun's first major decision after co-founder Scott McNealy's departure in mid-2006 was a promise to make much of their software, including Java, <span>free. T</span>his announcement was big news and some think it marks the potential for a new day in the life of Java. However, this effort is starting more than a decade after Java's creation, arguably too late to fix most of the problems.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Even with Sun's new GPL license, there is a lot of Java code out there that is not free and cannot be made so by Sun. Apple, for example, took Sun's PC implementation and worked extensively to port it to Macintosh. This code isn't free, and it doesn't seem likely that Apple will ever make it such. There is a company making Java run on mainframes, and their enhancements are proprietary as well. Even within the code Sun has recently made free, there are pieces Sun licensed from third parties, and they are having to re-write it because they can't get permission to change the license.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Even a free Java on its current trajectory will not absorb other communities. C# is considered better than Java, so those programmers are not making a switch. There are millions of web pages written in PHP, and I don't see them rushing to switch to Sun's Java either. Sun's code has been locked up for so long, there are few people in the outside world able to contribute. Why should the community fix a mess that was created only because Sun didn't work with the community in the first place?</p>
 <p class="calibre3">C# and .Net is the dominant platform on Windows, PHP is the dominant language on the Web, and Python and Mono are the most popular GC runtimes on the Linux desktop. So while Java is taught in universities, used for custom applications in enterprises, and has some success on mobile phones, these niches aren't enough to to ensure its long-term viability. Java has accumulated so much baggage, only some of which I have discussed here, that I think the software community should abandon it. This would also take a big step in lessening the problem of too many programming languages. In earlier drafts of my book, I proposed Sun create a next generation programming language, but I now believe there already are suitable codebases: Mono and Python.</p>
