 		Should all Ideas be Free?</h2> 	  <p class="calibre3">Science's complexity forces people to work together. Many therefore wonder if the success of Wikipedia and YouTube suggest that all forms of intellectual property, such as books and music, should also be free. This will be just one of the interesting economic questions for us to ponder in the early 21<sup class="calibre7">st</sup> century. As someone writing a book, this topic became very relevant to my wallet.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Fortunately, I have concluded that there is an important distinction between <i class="calibre5">static</i> and <i class="calibre5">dynamic</i> intellectual property. A song, once created, is not typically edited by a user. Software is often edited by a user because it often won't work until it is fixed to support an individual scenario.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Linus created Linux, but thousands of other people have put their stamp on it over the last 15 years, at a pace that is only increasing, improving on his humble creation to make it work better for themselves. Books, music and movies are often made by one person, or small teams of people, and are meant to be used as-is without the need for modification. (There may be a need to translate or re-dub a movie or song into other languages, but this doesn't require the same creative intellectual energy, and isn't something that requires further improvements over time.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Writing has been a way to make a living for many hundreds of years, and I am not ready to propose that we tweak society in such a fundamental way and remove longstanding incentives to create non-science. There is no such thing as a “proprietary book”, as by definition you can see what it contains and build on top of the ideas in it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Richard Stallman talks about a world where the music is free, but music players have a button where you can click to send $1 directly to the artist when you hear a song that you like. Such a world could provide a sufficient incentive to create free music, and it could be the choice of artists to create such an arrangement. We can create arbitrary rules, so let's experiment!</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Video Games and New Media</h4> <p class="calibre3">While books, music and movies are mostly static creations, video games are a mix of software and static multimedia. Video games contain the game engine that models the virtual world, but also contains 3-D models, music, a storyline, which are meant to be enjoyed as-is. Therefore, video games should continue to be sold for money to pay for the art, but the game engines could be GPL.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Making game engines free will allow for much more user-created content. iD Software, creators of the popular game Doom, did release their game engine, though it is a very old version of their code which they no longer use. Even so, a free software community has surrounded it! This version of Doom has never been used in any Xbox 360 game, but you can run it on an iPod.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Game creators today keep their game engine private because they consider it a competitive advantage — but it is also a huge part of their costs. The Halo series of video games, the most popular on the Xbox platform, spends three years between releases. A big part of the holdup is the software engine development.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A game engine is a piece of technology comparable in size to the Linux kernel because developers need lots of features:  </p>
 <ul class="calibre21"><p class="calibre3">the ability to model a world, create the 	rules of the game, and efficiently send updates between computers</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">text to speech, means to deal with cheaters, 	and other forms of AI.</p>
 </ul><p class="calibre3">If the thousands of game programmers around the world started working <span>together on the </span>software, I shudder to think what they might build! Hollywood might increase their investments in the game business if there were a free standard codebase: movies, video games and virtual reality are closely-related technologies.</p>
