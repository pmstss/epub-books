 	<span>Challenges</span> for Free 	Software</h1>  <i class="calibre5">“Bill doesn't really want to review your spec,” a colleague told me. “He just wants to make sure you've got it under control. His standard MO is to ask harder and harder questions until you admit that you don't know, and then he can yell at you for being unprepared. Nobody was really sure what happens if you answer the hardest question he can come up with, because it's never happened before.”</i> <i class="calibre5">Watching nonprogrammers trying to run software companies is like watching someone who doesn't know how to surf trying to surf. Even if he has great advisers standing on the shore telling him what to do, he still falls off the board again and again. The cult of the MBA likes to believe that you can run organizations that do things that you don't understand. But often, you can't.</i> <i class="calibre5">—<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080701/how-hard-could-it-be-glory-days.html"><span>Joel Spolsky</span></a>
</i> <i class="calibre5">The mode by which the inevitable is reached is effort.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Felix Frankfurter, US Supreme Court Justice</i> <p class="calibre3"><span>F</span>ree software has been around since 1985, and yet has only 1% marketshare on the desktop today. Free software has tremendous potential, but the community needs to execute better to win. In fact, until free software succeeds on the desktop, its last and biggest challenge, many will continue to question whether it is even viable.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">As a side note, while Microsoft doesn’t have a great reputation right now, especially because of Vista and malware, there is a lot of clever code and brilliant engineers inside the company. I was fortunate to learn from a bunch of great people in groups that fostered cultures of very high quality software.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">When Microsoft got serious about Internet Explorer, Netscape’s rag tag team of kids just out of college didn’t have a chance. MS took some of their top engineers in text engines, networking, forms, internationalization, performance, and object models, and put together a large, world-class team. Microsoft’s institutional knowledge of so many areas of software could be applied to any effort.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">People forget all that, but this is why the reviewers consistently would say that Windows was better than OS/2, Microsoft Word was easier to use WordPerfect, IE was faster than Netscape, Excel was richer than Lotus 1-2-3 3, ad infinitum. PC Magazine wrote in 1997: “Microsoft’s Java environment was the fastest and most compatible on our tests.” Microsoft had built a better runtime than Sun, the creator of the language!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Many think Microsoft won all these battles merely because they somehow magically became a monopoly, but the atriums in the buildings at Microsoft have shelves overflowing with awards from independent reviewers. Microsoft succeeded in all these areas because they used their financial success with DOS to hire an enormous army of smart programmers working in all areas of software, which could be applied to new areas, and passed on to new employees like me. And every time I switched groups, I’d take the knowledge and best practices I had learned in my previous groups.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">I am not an apologist for Microsoft, and I think they are in deep trouble over the long-term, but the idea that Microsoft came to utterly dominate the computer industry and lay waste to countless companies was not mere chance. In fact, a big part of Microsoft's success was the strategic or technical incompetence of its competitors.</p>
