AI and 	Google</h1>  <i class="calibre5">The future is open source everything.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Linus Torvalds</i> <i class="calibre5">That knowledge has become <i class="calibre5">the</i> resource, rather than <i class="calibre5">a</i> resource, is what makes our society post-capitalist.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Peter Drucker, 1993  </i> <p class="calibre3"><span>I</span>magine 1,000 people, broken up into groups of five, working on two hundred separate encyclopedias, versus that same number of people working on one encyclopedia? Which one will be the best? This sounds like a silly analogy when described in the context of an encyclopedia, but it is exactly what is going on in artificial intelligence (AI) research today.<a name="sdfootnote15anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote15sym" id="sdfootnote15anc"><sup class="calibre7">1</sup></a>
 Some say free software doesn't work in theory, but it does work in practice. In truth, it “works” in proportion to the number of people who are working together, and their collective efficiency.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In early drafts of this book, I had positioned this chapter after the     one explaining economic and legal issues around free software. However, <span>I</span> now believe it is important to discuss artificial intelli<span><span>gence separately and first, b</span></span>ecause AI is the holy-grail of computing, and the reason we haven't solved AI is that there are no free software codebases that have gained critical mass. Far more than enough people are out there, but they are usually working in teams of one or two people, or proprietary codebases.</p>
