How to try Linux</h1> <p class="calibre3">People wanted me to include a Linux CD with the book so that readers could try it out. However, this would add significant costs, makes the book annoying to hold, and free software is evolving so quickly that the CD would become obsolete immediately.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Instead, I suggest you burn a Linux “Live CD” which will run Linux right off the CD-ROM. This gives you a chance to play with Linux and see how it works without touching your existing operating system. <span>I thought it would be </span>hard<span> to make the switch given my many years deep experience with Windows, but within a few months I was using Linux 100% of the time.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Another way to see if you aren't sure if you are ready for Linux, try OpenOffice.org and Firefox, which also run on Windows and the Mac. Once you are using free formats and free applications, you are ready to switch. Demand your hardware and </span>software<span> suppliers support Linux so it will be there when you are ready. Demand free software and it will happen even faster.</span></p>
