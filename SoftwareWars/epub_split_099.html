Web</h2> <i class="calibre5">The first message ever to be sent over the ARPANET occurred at 10:30 PM on October 29, 1969. The message itself was simply the word “login”. The “l” and the “o” transmitted without problem but then the system crashed. Hence, the first message on the ARPANET was “lo”. They were able to do the full login about one hour later.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"><span>Wikipedia article on Internet precursor ARPANET</span></a>

</p>
 <p class="calibre3">One could write an entire book about the web, but I did want to include some ideas here.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">From a technical perspective, HTML has always been lacking as a text-formatting standard. It is important because of two reasons:</p>
  	<p class="calibre3">It is widely used: it's famous because it's 	famous.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">It has an easy deployment model.</p>
  <p class="calibre3">HTML was not designed in a rigorous way by text processing experts and so it never had the sort of awe-inspiring respect that Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting system has had. HTML was mature before it even added support for the concept of a page, which is why printing does not work well yet. Text processing is a hard problem, but not incorporating basic features like styles for seven years demonstrates that those guys were in over their heads and they shouldn't have reinvented the wheel.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In addition, the uptake of the JavaScript language outside of the web has been minimal. There is nothing web-specific about the language, and so it didn't even need to be created. It has just made the programming language tower of Babel situation worse.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In spite of its limitations, HTML today is the best cross-platform widget set and is supported by a vast array of tools, so enterprises should be using it for as many corporate applications as possible. A Boeing airplane could even have its entire cockpit UI be a w<span>eb</span> site. You can build something simple, reliable and pretty enough if you pick the right subset of HTML. Right now an airplane has a mess of buttons and knobs because each subsystem of the airplane has its own set; the guys who build the flaps don't want to share any buttons with those who control the overhead lights.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The web today is still far from being an appropriate tool for building rich applications, and nearly everything about the w<span>eb</span> is harder than building an equivalent functionality in a rich client application. Google has recently announced the Chrome operating system in a vision where all the apps run on the web, but even they have created a number of applications that presumably couldn't have been built using HTML, such as Google Earth, Picasa, and Google Desktop. Google Docs is an impressive web-based engineering effort, but it is slow, clumsy, feature-limited, doesn't work offline, has its own authentication mechanism, is hamstrung by the web's limited printing capabilities, and poses no threat to Microsoft's Office business any time soon. The most interesting capability of Google Docs is its support for real-time collaboration, but you don't need to re-build an entire application in HTML and Javascript to add this relatively small feature.<a name="sdfootnote111anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote111sym" id="sdfootnote111anc"><sup class="calibre7">9</sup></a>
</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The missing features of HTML are reasons why Adobe's Flash has become so popular. Flash started off as a failed client-based programming environment, but had a rebirth as a web plugin as a way to fix limitations in HTML.</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Adobe Flash</h4> <p class="calibre3">Flash is a primitive GC runtime whose primary advantage is that it is cross-platform like the web. Its programming language is known as ActionScript, which is based on the standard Ecmascript, and which is similar but incompatible with Javascript and JScript. (It is a mess.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Flash is interpreted, somewhat buggy and not a standard, nor is it available as free code. We should minimize the use of Flash because it is a big black box to the w<span>eb</span> server, w<span>eb</span> browser, search engines, and all existing HTML tools for building and managing websites. Flash also doesn't enforce UI standards. Every flash site works and looks different and sometimes I can't even tell what is a clickable button! Creators of the website, who myopically live in their application, don't notice it, but users visiting the website for the first time do.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Many websites built by non-technical people hire programmers to write a Flash website because of the UI candy it allows, but then they don't update their site for years because it would require hiring a programmer again. It is possible to build pretty, interactive w<span>eb</span> pages using only HTML and Javascript, as modern mapping websites have demonstrated. If you want a pretty website, use pretty pictures!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Limiting Flash to specific portions of specific pages, as YouTube does with its video player, is quite reasonable given certain limitations of the w<span>eb</span> and the mess of video standards, but building whole websites in Flash is a mistake and a threat to the w<span>eb</span>.</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Merging the Rich Client and the Web</h4> <p class="calibre3">In addition to its limitations, HTML has been stagnant since the release of 4.01 in 1999. We need to continue to evolve HTML, and push tools to keep up with the latest standard. Free software lowers the friction of code distribution and makes this easier to do. I worry that Internet Explorer will hold up progress on HTML because it is so popular, yet it is years behind in certain standards already, and Microsoft has disbanded the team several times.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">XHTML and HTML 5 are nascent efforts to improve the web, although they are still fundamentally limited because as standards they define the limits of what a web application can be. My computer has thousands of software components that web applications cannot call into because they are not part of the HTML standard.<a name="sdfootnote112anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote112sym" id="sdfootnote112anc"><sup class="calibre7">10</sup></a>
 The Internet is a transformational tool enabling all manner of collaboration, but using the HTML text format is not required.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The holy grail of computing is to find a way to merge the best of the rich client and the web. Java tried but failed to build a solid cross-platform set of widgets in an extensible runtime. Maybe the programming language that replaces C/C++ on the Linux desktop will revive this possibility. This is one of the interesting remaining challenges in computing.</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Web Etc.</h4> <p class="calibre3">The web needs more personalized content. I live in Seattle, and I am a huge fan of the Seahawks football team, but this is the news article ESPN is offering to me on a website today: “<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3358557&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines"><span>Bengals decline big Redskins offer for WR </span></a>
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3358557&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=ESPNHeadlines"><span>Johnson</span></a>
.” If they want me to click, they are going to have to do better than that.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Amazon.com has music samples I can listen to but that take 15 seconds to buffer before I can hear them. Music files on the web are often recorded below 192 kbps MP3, which means they sound worse than a CD and we are therefore going backwards to before 1982 technology.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Pictures should be big, and scale down on small screens. Drugstore.com has pictures that are at best 300 x 300 pixels:</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_m156b1d9b.jpg" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>Can you read the text on this box, like you could in a real store?</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> This is an actual “picture” of Mt. Saint Helens found on a website:</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_m1eec46de.jpg" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>This picture is not nearly as good as being there.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">An immersive reading experience is missing one thing: 200 dpi monitors. I saw such a monitor in 2002, and it was so pretty I could not pull my eyes away, but they have inexplicably been taken off the market.<a name="sdfootnote113anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote113sym" id="sdfootnote113anc"><sup class="calibre7">11</sup></a>
 Reading is tiring because it takes more work for your eyes to recognize letters when they are jaggy or blurry.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">The <span>web</span> needs to continue to integrate with other media like TV. The best way to implement interactive TV is to visually overlay HTML on top of the TV signal. The nice thing about this is that you could turn off the distracting crawling text along the bottom of the screen if you wanted. If the TV industry wanted a few features to make it look prettier than a web page, that would be very easy to do. A French company called Free is pioneering this, using free software as part of this effort. (A cable provider is a good example of a company which doesn't want to maintain a bunch of proprietary software.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Everyone who produces television shows should also create an XML schema which has information like who the guests are, etc. This extra information allows for a more personalized experience similar to what I get with the web: I could set my cable box to record whenever comedian Dennis Miller is on any channel. If a show runs over, which often happens with sports, the cable box would be smart enough to not stop recording; it needs just a tiny bit extra information to do this. Interactive TV is simply waiting for someone to create, and everyone to get behind, two simple standards, each of which would be less than 50 pages if they re-used HTML and XML. (It would also be nice to be able to watch the Seahawks no matter what city I live in. Comcast only offers me 4 football games per week. People complain: “There are 500 channels with nothing on.” In truth, we aren't to that point yet!)</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Hardware</h4> <p class="calibre3">Lots of people worry about running out of Internet bandwidth, but they are just being nattering nabobs of negativism. Nippon Telephone and Telegraph of Japan demonstrated sending 14 trillion bits per second down a single strand of fiber — or 2,660 music CDs in one second. We are not running up against the limits of the laws of physics yet!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Metering data sounds logical, although it would seem that the distance would provide a better measure. However, I counted the number of router hops required to get data from my home in Seattle to various destinations:</p>
 <dl class="calibre3"><dd class="calibre27"> 	<table width="351" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="calibre10"><col width="221" class="calibre11"/><col width="112" class="calibre11"/><tr class="calibre12"><th width="221" class="calibre17"> 				<p class="calibre3">Seattle to:</p>

 			</td> 			<td width="112" class="calibre13"> 				<p class="calibre3">23</p>
 			</td> 		</tr></table></dd></dl><p class="calibre3">In other words, the distance to the destination was not correlated with the amount of work required to route the packet to the destination. Therefore, routing based on the distance might not make sense. However, if we are going to meter based on bandwidth used, how does ten cents per gigabyte sound? For $20 per month, my Internet service provider gives me 200 gigabytes of data transfer, an IP address, a virtualization instance, ten gigabytes of redundant disk storage, and 360 MB of RAM. I get ten cents per gigabyte, and all that other stuff for free. 1 gigabyte for ten cents allows you to send two copies of the text of Encyclopedia Britannica, which would be all the <span>web</span> traffic many would need for a whole month.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Note that the cost of transmitting packets follows Moore's law because a router is just a specialized computer. Therefore, the cost of sending a packet is dropping exponentially. In 18 months, we should ask for five cents a gigabyte. The nice thing about moving to such a model is that it would create an incentive for people to offer ways to use more bandwidth. Cable companies would offer more HD content if they were getting paid more for the traffic.</p>
