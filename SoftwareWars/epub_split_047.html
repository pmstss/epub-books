 Digital Rights Management (DRM)</h2> <p class="calibre3"> Before the digital world, the enforcement of copyright law was limited by the physical restrictions of the real world. Book authors didn't worry much about people making unauthorized copies of their work because the expense of making an unauthorized copy approached the cost of purchasing a legal copy.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Enforcing arbitrary copyright provisions was not possible. You could not charge someone more who planned to lend out a book than someone who planned on keeping it for themselves, because the cost of enforcement would be greater than the profits.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In a digital world, however, anything is possible when it comes to creating rules for things. Stanford University law professor Lawrence Lessig has written about what terms like copyright and  trespass, mean in a digital world in an interesting work entitled <i class="calibre5">Code 2.0. </i>I will focus on just one aspect, digital enforcement of copyright, or Digital Rights Management (DRM). In fact, with DRM, <span>arbitrary </span>copyright provisions can now be created and enforced.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">An unintended consequence, however, is that whatever rules are created, whether onerous or not, you are provided no recourse because the rules are encoded in software. A paper book cannot prevent me from accessing its contents, but a digital one can. Here is a quote from a <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/09/06/21/1945216/Kindle-Zune-DRM-Restrictions-Coming-Into-Focus?from=rss">user</a>
 of the Microsoft Zune music service:</p>
 <i class="calibre5"> The vast majority of the music I had <i class="calibre5">purchased</i> last year is completely gone. There's no refund, the music doesn't exist on the service anymore, the files are just garbage now. Here's the error: “This item is no longer available at Zune Marketplace. Because of this, you can no longer play it or sync it with your Zune.”</i> <p class="calibre3">DRM has so far had mixed results. The first major use of DRM was in DVD players. Most people don't realize that DVDs have DRM because they can be very easily exchanged, unlike an iTunes song whose hassles are well-documented. (Note that the DRM remains on a DVD after its copyright has expired.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In fact the only time you can notice the DRM is when dealing with region encoding:</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_m2eca85e0.png" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>DVD region encoding map</p>
 <p class="calibre3">While this picture has a harmless, Benetton-esque, multicultural feel to it, it also creates a hassle for anybody who crosses those boundaries, and arguably decreases revenues. During layovers in European airports, <span>I have</span> often browsed selections of books, music and clothes, but I didn't purchase the European DVDs because they will not play on my North American player. I have a friend who lives in Latvia, and his choices in entertainment for his children are a tiny fraction of what is available in the U. S. because of this mechanism. The DVD region-encoding reinforces his country's third-world status.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In general, the DRM in DVD players is not onerous because it actually doesn't protect anything. The contents of the DVD are protected by DRM via encryption — but the key to its contents is also on the DVD!<a name="sdfootnote33anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote33sym" id="sdfootnote33anc"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a>
 Typing in a password to play a DVD player would not go over very well, so the password is put on the DVD. Once you can read any DVD, you can read them all. It is impossible to lock an object on its own.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Furthermore, the use of a DVD involves decoding it; the decoding mechanism by itself cannot distinguish whether the user intends to just watch the movie or post it on the Internet, so creating security to prevent people from copying DVDs is impossible.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Moreover, if a DVD is illegally posted on the Internet, then the security mechanism on all other copies of that DVD is now pointless because the information has already leaked out. In fact, the unencrypted version of the data is more useful because it doesn't have the restrictions on it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The key to security in any system is to have multiple layers of protection, a concept known as defense in depth. Inside a locked house, you might have a safe to store important documents and jewelry. An alarm system and cameras add additional levels of protection.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If you want to truly secure the contents of a DVD, you should put it in a safe, encrypt the contents with a key stored away from the DVD, secure access to the machine playing the DVD, make sure no third-party applications are running on the computer playing the DVD, etc.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">One can obviously see that these mechanisms don't make sense for the content we own. While I understand the interest in protecting copyrighted materials, we should not add complexity that serves no purpose.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Because DVD decoding is protected by patents with per-copy licensing fees, Microsoft decided not to include a means of playing DVDs in Windows XP. (Microsoft likes to charge per-copy license fees for its software but never likes to sign such license agreements itself! DVD playback is one of the applications that hardware vendors must include with Windows to make it fully-functional.)</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In fact, the DRM mechanisms create obstacles for the proprietary software vendors, who try to legally jump through these non-existent security hoops, even more than for the free software guys, who have just written code to do the job — and been prosecuted.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If you sat down to write code to play your DVDs on your own computer (not an easy task, I admit) you would be breaking the law! Jon Lech Johansen, one of three people who first wrote free code to play DVDs, suffered years of legal harassment.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1996 says that writing or distributing DVD decoding software is illegal because it “circumvents a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work.” It is the DVD industry that has deigned itself exclusive provider of technology to play your DVDs. Even if you wrote this software just to play your own DVDs, you are breaking the law, and Universal v. Reimerdes, the first lawsuit testing the DMCA, has upheld this. According to Judge Lewis Kaplan:</p>
 <i class="calibre5"> In the final analysis, the dispute between these parties is simply put if not necessarily simply resolved. Plaintiffs have invested huge sums over the years in producing motion pictures in reliance upon a legal framework that, through the law of copyright, has ensured that they will have the exclusive right to copy and distribute those motion pictures for economic gain. They contend that the advent of new technology should not alter this long established structure. Defendants, on the other hand, are adherents of a movement that believes that information should be available without charge to anyone clever enough to break into the computer systems or data storage media in which it is located. Less radically, they have raised a legitimate concern about the possible impact on traditional fair use of access control measures in the digital era. Each side is entitled to its views. In our society, however, clashes of competing interests like this are resolved by Congress. For now, at least, Congress has resolved this clash in the DMCA and in plaintiffs' favor. Given the peculiar characteristics of computer programs for circumventing encryption and other access control measures, the DMCA as applied to posting and linking here does not contravene the First Amendment.</i> <p class="calibre3">It appears that the defendants never argued the point that it should be possible to write your own software to play your own DVDs.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The Digital Media <span>Consumer </span>Rights Act, a bill proposed but not passed by Congress, redefines such software to the status of barely legal. You would be allowed to run “unlicensed” code to play DVDs as long as you are doing it for legal purposes. This makes good sense: playing a DVD isn't a problem, posting that movie on the Internet is the problem!</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>DRM scenarios are also very limited in their scope. Your iPod's DRM is incompatible with your cable box's DRM. As such, you will never be able to watch your TV shows on your iPod because the industry is unable to arrive at a DRM scheme on which everyone can agree. (In fact, you can't even share videos between cable boxes in your home today!)</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">There could certainly be uses of DRM that make sense. For example, you could rent a movie which would expire after a period of time, using DRM as the enforcement of the expiration. The debate should focus on rent versus own scenarios as wholly separate classes of transactions.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Another compromise is to create a mechanism where media is stamped with the textual string naming the owner, the digital equivalent of writing one's name on the inside cover of a book. This can be done without encrypting the data.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In general, however, the focus shouldn't be on ways to restrict information, but on<span> ways to make it available. It seems like the </span><span>recording industry spends more time coming up with new ways to inconvenience customers than in coming up with new ways to increase the quality of the user experience of digital media. When </span><span>you figure a global middle class of billions of people, worrying about the pirates who live on the edge of society, or on the edge of subsistence, is a mistake. </span> </p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>People will steal if they want to steal. One of the reasons people stole video </span>games<span> in the past was because it was not easy to try out a game before you bought it. Now, with the Internet, you can download free demo games and make an informed decision what games </span><span>you want to buy in the future. Does providing free demos help or hurt sales? I don't know the answer to this question, but it does make for a better informed and discriminating customer; something from which we all benefit in the long run.</span><span><a name="sdfootnote34anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote34sym" id="sdfootnote34anc"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a>
