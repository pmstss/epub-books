Reverse Engineering</h2> <p class="calibre3">Imagine trying to fix a car without having any of the documentation produced by the car manufacturer. Much technology in the computing world today is undocumented, which means that a lot of what free software developers have to do is reverse-engineering, a tedious and time-consuming task. I don't believe the Publisher format is publicly documented, so someone would need to create lots of little files and look through the on-disk binary to figure out the particulars of how formatting is stored on disk. It is sort of amazing that millions of people create files in formats that are not publicly described, yet this is the state of the industry today. Unfortunately, this means the user is enslaved to his software vendor, and arguably doesn't even truly own their documents.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">If everyone used free standards, let alone free code, software progress would be faster. Today, if a standard is created, the community almost never gets any code to go with it. It might be best to have code be the official reference, rather than a written specification, but today we often have neither. If the computing world ever breaks out of this vicious cycle, maybe we could focus our collective efforts on the truly hard challenges.</p>
