 Copyright provides sufficient protection</h2> <p class="calibre3"><span>Patents are </span>a powerful right because they give their owners exclusive access to an idea. Proving that you invented an idea independently is not a defense. A much less exclusive right is what is allowed <span>in copyright law.</span> Copyright law protects someone from stealing words or code, but if you can prove you came up with it via independent means, you have a sufficient defense.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In the old days of software, Word and WordPerfect kept adding each other's features in order to convert users. They didn't need exclusive access to an idea to be motivated to write software, and patents would have decreased the level of competition.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Giving exclusive access to an idea can encourage people to rest on their laurels, or even be a squatter on an idea, taking money from anyone who happens to run across it, but not using it for their own purposes. Many times, patents are created merely as a defensive measure against other companies. A company will patent things with the hope it can trip up anyone who might come calling with claims <i class="calibre5">against </i>them.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In a world filled with free software, it is the copyleft mechanism, not the patent mechanism, that will provide protection for software. Even proprietary software would not stop improving if software patents disappeared, though their lawyers would scream like stuck pigs.</p>
