 		Definition of Free Software</h2> 	  <i class="calibre5">Nothing today, likely nothing since we tamed fire, is genuinely new: Culture, like science and technology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those who came before.  </i> <i class="calibre5">—Judge Alex Kozinski, US Court of Appeals</i> <i class="calibre5">Making Linux use the GPL license was definitely the best thing I ever did.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Linus Torvalds</i> <p class="calibre3">Because software is a science, as a society we need to create license agreements which allow and even encourage cooperation among programmers. Computers scientists need software to be freely available for them to do their work.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Richard Stallman has defined the <span>four basic software freedoms:</span></p>
  	<i class="calibre5">The freedom to run the 	program, for any purpose. (You, not your software, are in control of 	what is happening.)</i> 	<i class="calibre5">The freedom to study 	how the program works and adapt it to your needs.</i> 	<i class="calibre5">The freedom to give a 	copy of the program to your neighbor. Sharing ideas is impossible 	without sharing the program to create and display them.</i> 	<i class="calibre5">The freedom to improve 	the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that 	the whole community benefits.</i>  <p class="calibre3">The GNU General Public License (GPL) is the copyright mechanism he came up with to protect those freedoms, which will allow maximal re-use of advancements. The goal is to protect the freedom of the user of free software. Without the ability to study and manipulate the software, you are greatly limited in your ability to use it and further advance it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Copyright was created to protect the creators from the publishers (those with the means to make copies), by granting the creator exclusive rights. The GNU <span>GPL is sometimes called </span><i class="calibre5"><span>“copyleft”</span></i><span>, because it grants the same expansive rights to everyone, creator, and user.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">It sounds backwards to protect users rather than creators, but protecting users also helps creators. All Linux programmers except Linus started off as users. Linus was the first user of Linux as well as being the first contributor to Linux. He fully owned his code and could fix any problem he found. Copyleft ensures that code protected with this license provides those same guarantees to future users and creators.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Copyleft helps Linus because it requires programmers who improve Linux to give back to his invention. Linux only ran on a 80386 CPU when first released because that is what Linus owned. All the improvements that it took to run on the other processors got put into Linux, to the benefit of Linus, and everyone else.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Whatever you think of free software today, using it is a choice. In fact, creating it is a charitable act, and we should be grateful to Linus Torvalds for releasing his work, just like we should be grateful to Einstein for making his E=mc<sup class="calibre7">2</sup> theory publicly available and not just stuffing it in a drawer.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many of the other blue-chip computer companies do not yet accept the idea that software should be free in the ways that Stallman defines above. According to them, you can generally run the code for whatever purpose, but not copy, study, or enhance it.</span></p>
