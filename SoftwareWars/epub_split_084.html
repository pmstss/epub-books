 Software that doesn't work is not worth anything.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">As I write this, the Linux kernel has 1,400 active bugs, and the median age of those bugs is ten months — a number three times longer than its release schedule. In general, a bug, whenever it is found, should get a fix put in the next release. The Linux kernel is shipping frequently, but many bugs are taking three to four releases to get fixed.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Bugs get stale if they sit around for too long. If I file a bug against some device driver, and the owner of the code gets back to me one year later, I may not have all the necessary pieces set up to reproduce the bug again. Therefore, the bug must be resolved as not-reproduced and can get fixed only when the next unhappy customer finds it. Furthermore, the fact that a buglist already appears voluminous discourages people from adding to it.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">One might believe that the Linux programmers are fixing bugs as fast as they can, but in fact they aren't. The Linux kernel development team has thousands of contributors and thousands of bugs, so fixing their bugs is a very manageable task — if they make it a priority.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The good news is that it is easier to fix bugs than to write code because writing code involves design, which in turn requires difficult choices to be made. (e.g. How do I add this feature?) In the bug-fixing phase of a software product cycle, most of the hard decisions have already been made, so it is mostly a matter of making small tweaks — the architectural equivalent of changing a blueprint to move a sink a few inches.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Fixing these bugs might be tedious, especially when the developer doesn't have access to the hardware he is trying to debug, but everything about hardware is tedious so they may as well just do it now. PC hardware contains 10,000 devices, along with a tremendous amount of unnecessary complexity and undocumented designs, but the messiness of the PC has existed from the moment Linus first created his kernel. Linus, however, has the means to <span>make all </span>PC hardware work on Linux: lean on hardware vendors to support free software, and crack the whip on his kernel developers!</p>
 <p class="calibre3">1,400 bugs for something as big and actively evolving as the Linux kernel is not a disaster at all. But if Linux kernel developers focused on the buglist for just a few months, the bug total could be brought down to less than 50. Linux's goal should be to fix 90% of new bugs in the next release, and 99% within two releases. This accomplishment would represent yet another breakthrough for a project of this size and complexity. Linux is a superior kernel to Windows today, but it needs a bit more work on the mess that is today's PC hardware.<a name="sdfootnote100anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote100sym" id="sdfootnote100anc"><sup class="calibre7">7</sup></a>
 The whip Linus must crack on his kernel developers is actually nothing more than a feather boa.</p>
