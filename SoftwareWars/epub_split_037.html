Software is math</h2> <p class="calibre3">Software is math. In the 1930s, Alonzo Church created a mathematical system known as lambda (<span lang="zxx">λ</span>) calculus, an early programming language that used math as its foundation, and which could express any program written today.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A patent on software is therefore a patent on math, something that historically has not been patentable. Donald Knuth, one of America's most preeminent computer scientists, <a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/knuth-to-pto.txt"><span>wrote</span></a>
 in a letter to the <span>U. S.</span> Patent Office in 2003:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">I am told that the courts are trying to make a distinction between mathematical algorithms and non mathematical algorithms. To a computer scientist, this makes no sense, because every algorithm is as mathematical as anything could be. An algorithm is an abstract concept unrelated to the physical laws of the universe.</i> <i class="calibre5"><span>Nor is it possible to distinguish between “numerical” and “nonnumerical” algorithms, as if numbers were </span>somehow<span> different from other kinds of precise information. All data are numbers, and all numbers are data.</span></i> <i class="calibre5"><span>Congress wisely decided long ago that mathematical things cannot be patented. Surely nobody could apply </span>mathematics<span> if it were necessary to pay a license fee whenever the theorem of Pythagoras is employed. The basic algorithmic ideas that people are now rushing to patent are so fundamental, the result threatens to be like what would happen if we allowed authors to have patents on individual words and concepts.</span></i> <i class="calibre5"><span>I strongly believe that the recent trend to </span>patenting<span> algorithms is of benefit only to a very small number of attorneys and inventors, while it is seriously harmful to the vast majority of people who want to do useful things with computers.</span></i> <p class="calibre3">Software doesn't look like math, but it is built up from just a few primitive operations that have a mathematical foundation. Allowing people to patent particular algorithms just means that a section of our math is now owned by someone. If all of these patents become owned by many different entities, then math could become unusable by anyone. Then where would we be?</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Ironically, when defending itself in a patent infringement case with AT&amp;T, Microsoft argued that software cannot be patented:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">Justice Scalia: “You can't patent, you know, on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?”</i> <i class="calibre5">Microsoft attorney, Ted Olson: “That's correct, Justice Scalia. [...] An idea or a principle, two plus two equals four, can't be patented.”</i> <p class="calibre3">The Supreme Court ruled that “unincorporated software, because it is intangible information, cannot be typed a 'component' of an invention.” One might read this and conclude that the Supreme Court, unknowingly, and at Microsoft's behest, outlawed software patents!<a name="sdfootnote31anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote31sym" id="sdfootnote31anc"><sup class="calibre7">2</sup></a>
