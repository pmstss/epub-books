 		Java as GPL from Day 0</h2> 	  <p class="calibre3">If Sun had created Java with a GPL license, the landscape of the software industry would look completely different today, and computers would be more reliable and smarter. Java would be more reliable, simpler, richer, and faster, and a community, like C and C++, that Microsoft tools developers would have been a part of.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Many more programmers would have contributed to Java and built something much better. These mistakes stunted Java's growth, but even worse, it caused many software programmers just to continue to plod along in their C or C++ codebases. It gave rise to C# and to other free languages like Javascript, PHP, Python, and Ruby. These were created to fill niches that Java didn't meet.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The success of C was in part due to its widespread support, which made it easier to share code than did its predecessor on the PC â€” assembly language. It is hard to share code across languages, and the proliferation of new ones has gotten worse since Java was created, when it should have gone in the opposite direction.<a name="sdfootnote68anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote68sym" id="sdfootnote68anc"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a>
 Even within Sun, there is a group of people trying to build another programming language called Fortress, which will be suitable for scientific computing. They too believe Java is not sufficient as it is.<a name="sdfootnote69anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote69sym" id="sdfootnote69anc"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a>
