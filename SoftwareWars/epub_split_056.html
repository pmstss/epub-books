 		Functionality and Usability</h2> 	  <p class="calibre3">Functionality and usability are “soft” features — lower priority amongst the other software quality factors. If your computer corrupts your files while saving them to disk, you don't care how rich or usable the application was up to that point.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span><span>Many consumer devices today are often not very usable because the people building those devices </span></span>write<span><span> 100% custom code, often in assembly language. It takes a lot of effort merely to get the software working, and once it is, the device manufacturers become fearful of changing anything lest they break it.</span></span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>One of my groups at Microsoft, called Spot, ran C# interpreted on a $50 watch. The code was efficient because we focused on the high-level performance issues that you never seem to get to when you write in C or C++. In fact, the processor ran at just a few percent on average. Our code was so fast that it hardly ever ran, which was great for battery life! The watch failed in the marketplace, but it was reliable, rich, and easy to use. We were able to tweak the UI based on feedback right up until the end simply because we could without breaking things. Modern tools can go everywhere, even to devices constrained by cost and size, and their greater use will make consumer devices easier to use.</span></p>
