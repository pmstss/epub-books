 	The OS Battle</h1>  <i class="calibre5">Free software works well in a complex environment. Maybe nobody at all understands the big picture, but evolution doesn’t require global understanding, it just requires small local improvements and an open market (“survival of the fittest”).</i> <i class="calibre5">—Linus Torvalds</i> <i class="calibre5">I've been a big proponent of Microsoft Windows Vista over the past few months, even going so far as loading it onto most of my computers and spending hours tweaking and optimizing it. So why, nine months after launch, am I so frustrated? The litany of what doesn't work and what still frustrates me stretches on endlessly.</i> <i class="calibre5">Take sleep mode, for example. Vista promised a new low-power sleep mode that would save energy yet enable nearly instantaneous resume. Poppycock. The brand-new dual-core system I built a few months ago totters off to sleep but never returns. I have to cold-start it to bring it back. This after replacing virtually every driver inside.</i> <i class="calibre5">Take my media center PC, for example. It's supposed to serve up photos, videos, and music. Instead, it often simply drops off the network for absolutely no reason.</i> <i class="calibre5">I could go on and on about the lack of drivers, the bizarre wake-up rituals, the strange and nonreproducible system quirks, and more. But I won't bore you with the details.</i> <i class="calibre5">—<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170276,00.asp"><span lang="zxx"><span>Jim Louderback</span></span></a>
, Editor in Chief of PC Magazine.</i> <p class="calibre3"><span>W</span>indows revenue of $16 billion is larger than the GDP of many countries, and it is this dominance that provides technical and financial competitive advantages that fuel Microsoft's success everywhere else. The battle for the desktop computing OS is an epic struggle seldom seen in the history of business, and the success of Linux on the desktop will reinvigorate the PC as a tool much more powerful than a word processor and a web browser.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">To a Linux distribution, the kernel is just the software that makes all the other software run, and is one <span>of the thousands of components they integrate</span>. The Linux kernel by itself will not defeat Windows — it requires an entire distribution. Therefore, it is worth analyzing the state of the OS market.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">There are many producers of Linux distributions, but in the PC world the four most important teams are: Red Hat, Novell, Debian, and an upstart created in 2004, Ubuntu. There are hundreds of other Linux distributors, but most of them are merely using the big four's efforts and tweaking them further for more specialized markets. Each of these four will be discussed over the next few pages, but it is worth mentioning a name that isn't on the list, IBM.</p>
