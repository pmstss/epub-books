The Next-Gen DVD Mess</h2> <p class="calibre3">Like many other things in the computer industry, the next generation format for high definition DVDs was a mess for several years because two standards were created: HD-DVD and Blu-Ray. Both formats are high quality and their discs look the same, but the playback hardware is inexplicably incompatible.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Fortunately, in early 2008, HD-DVD was abandoned, although billions of dollars were wasted because the two camps bickered like twin sisters, and couldn't agree on a few minuscule technical details before they went to market. The bad news is that Blu-Ray adoption is slow. In mid-2009, it was <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Bluray-Adoption-Still-Sluggish-HDTV-Sales-Up/">reported</a>
 that HD-DVD players are 60% more popular than Blu-Ray, even though it had been abandoned by the industry. Furthermore, why pay $300 for a new player when all of the movies we already own are not in that format? Why should we pay full price merely to get a higher quality copy of something we already own? Didn't we really mean to purchase a high quality copy in the first place? The best way for faster adoption would be to create a service where you mail in your old VHS or DVDs, and they mailed you back HD versions of them for a few dollars each. That could be a huge, if low-margin, business.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"> Consumers would adopt new standards faster if they could immediately enjoy everything they already own in that new format at something approaching the actual cost of producing a disc, instead of the full retail price. This is another area where shrinking the copyright expiration will help. It will make nearly free all those things we paid a license fee for, but which we now only have low-quality reproductions of.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">At some point, the industry should remove the Interpol and DHS warnings about why we shouldn't have stolen what we are about to watch. When you stick in a disc, there should be two buttons that show up within 5 seconds: “Play” and “Menu.” I have a boxed set of DVDs that display four minutes of introductory warnings and self-promotion that I cannot even skip through, before playing the actual content. I once put in the wrong disc and so had to repeat the hassle. This may seem petty, but these encroachments get worse. I have to accept the license agreement of my navigation system every time I turn on my car!<a name="sdfootnote106anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote106sym" id="sdfootnote106anc"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a>
 When people feel ripped off and treated like a sucker, a culture is created where people decide not to pay for what is sold. Respect is a two-way street.</p>
