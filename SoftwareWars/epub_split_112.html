Acknowledgments</h2> <p class="calibre3">I would like to acknowledge my family, friends, teachers, colleagues, reviewers, etc. The total list would be very long and I would likely leave out or misspell names that would mean nothing to my readers, so I won't even try. I am not great about staying in touch, but that doesn't mean I don't cherish our time together.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The cover art was created by Nils Seifert and the cover was designed by Alex Randall.</p>

 Since 	I wrote this, Google has started to release more of their software, 	but it is the less interesting stuff. Even worse, in a number of 	cases there is another free implementation already written. Google 	in 2010 believes that free software is only appropriate in specific 	places, and they do not believe they would be better off if they had 	written 100% free software from the beginning. I talk more about 	Google in a later chapter.</p>

 While 	cloud computing, the movement of increasing number of applications 	and services provided over the Internet, is one of the hot topics of 	today, it is unrelated to the Windows vs. Macintosh vs. Linux war 	that is going on. Even in a future where applications like 	word-processing are done over the Internet, you still need a kernel, 	a web browser, a media player, and so forth.</p>

 This 	should arguably be expressed as XML, but because there is common 	code that reads these values and provides them to applications, and 	because each file contains only one value, this problem isn't very 	significant; the kernel's configuration information will never be a 	part of a web mashup.</p>

 <span>These 	studies have limited value because their tools usually analyze just 	a few types of coding errors. Then, they make the IT news, and get 	fixed quickly because of the publicity, which then makes the study 	meaningless. However, these tools do allow for comparisons between 	codebases. I believe the best analysis of the number of Linux bugs 	is the 1,400 bugs in its bug database, which for 8.2 million lines 	of code is .17 bugs per 1,000 lines of code. This is a tiny number, 	though it could easily be another 100 times smaller. Here is a link 	to the Linux kernel's active bugs: </span><a href="http://tinyurl.com/LinuxBugs"><span><span>http://tinyurl.com/LinuxBugs</span></span></a>

 This 	is a way to add additional security because the operating system can 	say, for example: Because a media player has no reason to write 	files to disk, the system can take away this permission. Before the 	kernel tries to do anything interesting, it will ask the Mandatory 	Access System (MAC) whether such an operation is allowed. The 	security checks in most <span>other</span> 	operating systems simply ask if <span><span>the 	</span></span><i class="calibre5">person</i> is allowed to do something.<br class="calibre4"/>Creating 	a default policy adds additional work for application writers, and 	by itself doesn't entirely solve the problem. A word processor needs 	complete read and write access, so how do you solve the problem of a 	virus in a document macro opening all of your files and writing 	junk? SELinux doesn't deal with this situation because it doesn't 	have this information. In garbage-collected programming languages, 	it is possible to walk the stack and determine more information 	about whether a macro, or the word processor itself, is asking to 	open a file.</p>

 The 	alternative is for each component to use the previous version of all 	of its dependent components, which means that the features in the 	latest Internet Explorer wouldn't show up in various places that are 	using the old version. However, does the Help system need the latest 	version?</p>

 In 	Windows Vista, Microsoft moved <i class="calibre5">some</i> of the device drivers to 	user mode but they should have kept the device drivers small, 	simple, and in the kernel and instead moved the widgets and fluff to 	user mode.</p>

 Two 	of the biggest differences in strategy is User Mode Linux (UML) 	which changes Linux to run as an application on top of another 	instance of Linux, and the standard virtualization, which runs the 	guest OS in kernel mode, though it doesn't actually talk to the 	hardware. The Linux kernel is evolving towards figuring out the 	architecture, and what is shared between the different strategies.</p>

 I 	argue in another place in the book that software has no clear 	boundaries. What I meant was that one never really knows precisely 	what the interface between manager and manipulator should be. For 	audio files, the boundary seems clear: here is some audio data, chew 	on it. However even there you must ask: what DSP APIs are available 	to the plugins? Otherwise, each plugin will need lots of duplicate 	code that the manager already likely has! It is the new hardware 	capabilities that create a need for a change at this boundary. The 	lesson here is to keep your boundaries simple, but assume you may 	need to change them.</p>

 Many 	embedded scenarios don't include a GUI because there is no standard 	one yet. Most GUIs are too complicated and slow for embedded 	scenarios: the brand-new cash register at my local Starbucks has a 	touch display with a text interface.</p>

 There 	are various privacy issues inherent in robot-driven cars. When 	computers know their location, it becomes easy to build a “black 	box” that would record all this information and even transmit it 	to the government. We need to make sure that machines owned by a 	human stay under his control, and do not become controlled by the 	government without a court order and a compelling burden of proof.</p>

 His 	prediction is that the number of computers, times their 	computational capacity, will surpass the number of humans, times 	their computational capacity, in 2045. Therefore, the world will be 	amazing then.</p>
 	<p class="calibre3">      This calculation is flawed for 	several reasons:</p>
 	 		<p class="calibre3">We will 		be swimming in computational capacity long before 2040. Today, my 		computer is typically running at 2% CPU when I am using it, and 		therefore has 50 times more computational capacity than I need. An 		intelligent agent twice as fast as the previous one is not 		necessarily more useful.</p>
 		<p class="calibre3">Many of 		the neurons of the brain are not spent on reason, and so shouldn't 		be in the calculations.</p>
 		<p class="calibre3">Billions 		of humans are merely subsisting, and are not plugged into the 		global grid, and so shouldn't be measured.</p>
 		<p class="calibre3">There is 		no amount of continuous learning built in to today's software.</p>
 		<p class="calibre3">Each of 		these would tend to push Singularity forward and support the 		argument that the benefits of singularity are not waiting on 		hardware. Humans make computers smarter, and computers make humans 		smarter, and this feedback loop makes 2045 a meaningless 		moment.<br class="calibre4"/>Who in the past fretted: “When will man build a device 		that is better at carrying things than me?” Computers will do 		anything we want, at any hour, on our command. A computer plays 		chess or music because we want it to. Robotic firemen will run into 		a burning building to save our pets. Computers have no purpose 		without us. We should worry about robots killing humans as much as 		we worry about someone stealing an Apache helicopter and killing 		humans today.</p>

 Most 	computers today contain a dual-core CPU and processor folks promise 	that 10 and more are coming. Intel's processors also have limited 	4-way parallel processing capabilities known as MMX and SSE. Intel 	could add even more of this parallel processing support if 	applications put them to better use. Furthermore, graphics cards 	exist to do work in parallel, and this hardware could also be 	adapted to AI if it is not usable already.</p>

 Although 	Google doesn't give away or sell their source code, they do sell an 	appliance for those who want a search engine for the documents on an 	internal Intranet. This appliance is a black box and is, by 	definition, managed separately than the other hardware and software 	in a datacenter.<br class="calibre4"/>It also doesn't allow tight integration with 	internal applications. An example of a feature important to 	Intranets is to have the search engine index all documents I have 	access to. The Internet doesn't really have this problem as 	basically everything is public. Applications are the only things 	that know who has access to all the data. It isn't clear that Google 	has attacked this problem and because the appliance is not 	extensible, no one other than Google can fix this either. This 	feature is one reason why search engines should be exposed as part 	of an application.  	</p>

: 	freshness, which gives priority to recently-changed web pages. It 	also tries to classify queries into categories like places and 	products. Another new tweak is to not display too many results of 	one kind: they try to mix in news articles, advertisements, a 	Wikipedia entry, etc. These enhancements are nice, but are far from 	actually understanding what is in the articles, and it appears to be 	applying smarts to the search query rather than the data gathered by 	the spiders.</p>

 Focusing 	on the spider side means continually adding new types of information 	into the database as it starts to understand things better. Let's 	say you build a spider that can now understand dates and guess the 	publication date of the page. (This can be tricky when a web page 	contains biographical information and therefore many dates.) Spiders 	will then start to tag all the web pages it reads in the future with 	this new information. All of this tagging happens when the data is 	fetched, so that is where the intelligence needs to go.</p>

 In 	fact, WordPress's biggest problem is that the 3rd party development 	is too rich, and in fact chaotic. There are hundreds of themes and 	plugins, many that duplicate each other's functionality. But grocery 	stores offer countless types of toothpaste, and this has not been an 	insurmountable problem for consumers. I talk more about this topic 	in a later chapter.</p>

 There 	is the total cost of ownership (TCO), but that is a comparative 	measure of software quality. If you use some free software to help 	you make a website, the cost of that software is the amount of time 	you spend with it to accomplish your task. If one tool builds a 	website in half the time, or builds one twice as nice, then the TCO 	of those software packages is different, even if both are free.<br class="calibre4"/>If 	a car company gave away their top of the line cars for free, the 	demand would be very high, even though the owners still had to 	purchase gas and had other ongoing costs.<br class="calibre4"/>Even if two pieces of 	software have the same TCO, there is an additional cost: the cost of 	switching from one to the next. Software is not interchangeable in 	the way that the laws of supply and demand envision. In fact, the 	switching costs between software often dwarfs the difference in 	their TCO.</p>

 Justice 	Alito, in a concurring opinion states: “To be sure, if these 	computers could not run Windows without inserting and keeping a 	CD-ROM in the appropriate drive, then the CD-ROMs might be 	components of the computer. But that is not the case here.” 	Actually, Linux Live CDs allow you to run the OS directly off the 	CD-ROM.

 When 	I do enable their nascent 3-D features, the computer doesn't suspend 	and resume properly anymore. And the cursor would sometimes become 	malformed.

 In 	fairness to Intel, that bug happened on average once in every nine 	million division operations, and would return results that were off 	by less than 0.000061. Testing a 64-bit processor's math 	capabilities involves 2<sup class="calibre7">128</sup>, or 10<sup class="calibre7">38</sup> test 	cases! Intel does continuously release errata lists about their 	processors. For example, initializing a computer is a very 	complicated process with plenty of room for ambiguity, yet because 	user data isn't even in memory yet, there is no risk of a hardware 	bug causing a newsworthy problem.</p>

 Perhaps 	the next most important innovation of Lisp over C is functional 	programming. Functional programming is a focus on writing code which 	has no side effects; the behavior of a function depends only on its 	parameters, and the only result of a function is its return value. 	Nowadays, in object-oriented programming, people tend to create 	classes with lots of mutable states, so that the behavior of a 	function depends on so many things that it is very hard to write 	correct code, prove it is correct, support multiple processors 	manipulating that object at the same time, etc. Functional 	programming is a philosophy, and Lisp made it natural.</p>

 Most 	Lisp implementations ran 10x slower than C because it was 	interpreted rather than compiled to machine code. It is possible to 	compile Lisp, but unfortunately, almost no one bothered. If someone 	complained about Lisp performance, the standard answer was that they 	were considering putting the interpreter into hardware, i.e. a Lisp 	computer. This never happened because it would have sucked Lisp into 	the expensive silicon race.</p>

 Some 	argue that static type checking (declaring all types in the code so 	the compiler can flag mismatch errors) is an alternative way of 	making software more reliable, but while it can catch certain 	classes of bugs, it doesn't prevent memory leaks or buffer 	overruns.<br class="calibre4"/>Likewise, there are “smart pointers” which can 	emulate some of the features of garbage collection, but it is not a 	standard part of languages and doesn't provide many of the 	benefits.<br class="calibre4"/>Apple's Objective C 2.0 has added support for GC in 	their language, but it is optional, and therefore doesn't provide 	many of the benefits of a fully GC language, like enabling 	reflection or preventing buffer overruns.</p>

 The 	rocket's software was written in Ada, an old language, but with many 	of the features of garbage collection. Code which converted a 64-bit 	integer to a 16-bit integer received a number too big to fit into 16 	bits, and so the conversion code threw an exception. The code to 	handle this exception was disabled, and therefore the computer 	crashed. When this computer crashed, it started sending confusing 	diagnostic information to the flight control computer, causing it to 	fly in a crazy way and break apart, triggering the internal 	self-destruct mechanisms.<br class="calibre4"/>Many blame management, but this was a 	simple design bug (you should be very careful when throwing away 	data). This was compounded because they were using a specialized 	embedded system with a non-mainstream programming language which 	allowed them the capability of disabling certain exceptions. This 	bug could have been caught in testing, but they didn't use accurate 	trajectory information in the simulations. Perhaps clumsy tools made 	it hard to modify test cases, and so they never got updated.</p>

 The 	problem is even worse because every big C/C++ application has its 	own memory allocators. They grab the memory from the OS in large 	chunks and manage it themselves. Now if you are done with memory, 	you need to return to the person who gave it to you.</p>

 GC 	makes it easy for programmers to freely pass around objects that 	more than one piece of code is using at the same time, and the 	memory will be cleaned up only when every piece of code is finished 	with it. C and C++ do not enable this and many other common 	scenarios.<br class="calibre4"/>To write code which allows two pieces of software to 	share memory and to return it to the operating system only when both 	are finished is complicated and onerous. The simplest way to 	implement this feature in C/C++ is to do reference counting: have a 	count of the number of users of a piece of memory. COM, and the 	Linux and Windows kernels have reference counting. When the last 	user is finished, the count turns to zero and that last user is 	responsible for returning the memory to the OS. Unfortunately, this 	feature requires complicated nonstandard code (to handle multiple 	processors) and places additional burdens on the programmer because 	he now needs to keep track of what things are referencing each 	other. Handing out references, which should be simple, is now 	error-prone. Even so, reference counting is insufficient: if two 	objects point to each other, but no one points to them, they will 	keep each other alive.</p>

 The 	Linux kernel is an example of reliable C code. Many might use this 	as proof that it is possible to write reliable code without garbage 	collection. However, there are several reasons why this lesson may 	not be valid:<br class="calibre4"/>The kernel's primary job is to provide glue code to 	make the hardware work. Seventy-five percent of the kernel's code is 	hardware specific, and much of the code is tiny, simple components. 	Much of the remaining code implements decades-old operating system 	concepts like threads. This makes the feature requirements and 	design relatively stable over time. All of the things we consider 	smart software, like grammar checkers and speech and handwriting 	recognition, involve writing code which has no clear design and 	would never be part of a kernel.<br class="calibre4"/>The kernel doesn't have the need 	to inter-operate with as much other software like applications do. 	Software written by many disparate and interdependent teams makes GC 	more important.<br class="calibre4"/>The Linux kernel has a big team per line of code 	compared to other codebases. This gives them the luxury of using 	inefficient tools.<br class="calibre4"/>The Linux kernel does have a few memory leaks 	even as I write this. (Bugs 5029, 6335, 8332, 8580)<br class="calibre4"/>The kernel 	has a number of specialized requirements which make it harder to do 	garbage collection, but it would benefit from it, and it wouldn't 	surprise me if most of the kernel's code which is not written in an 	assembly language is written in a GC language one day.<br class="calibre4"/>For now, 	we should focus on porting application code and leave the Linux 	kernel as the very last piece of code written in C. Once the world 	has collaborated on a new software stack, written in our new 	programming language, we can knock on Linus's door with our now 	mature tools and figure out what his requirements are.</p>

 Building 	emulation in hardware was not a good idea because you cannot mix 	32-bit and 64-bit code because you cannot hand a 64-bit pointer to 	32-bit code. You would have to boot the computer into a 32-bit mode 	where it never created a 64-bit memory address in order to let all 	code to run, and such a feature would defeat the purpose of building 	a 64-bit OS.<br class="calibre4"/>In 2006, Intel removed their x86 hardware 	interpreter, which ran the code 10 times slower than native, and 	replaced it with software that would dynamically re-compile the x86 	binary to Itanium instructions. The code still couldn't interoperate 	with true 64-bit code, but it could run at full speed, and it 	lowered the cost of building an Itanium. It is ironic that Intel had 	put into its hardware precisely what it was trying to get rid of!</p>

 The 	two most common theories for the failure of IA-64 are: performance 	benchmarks which weren't significantly better than Intel's current 	processors, and incremental mechanisms to add 64-bit computing to 	x86 without starting from scratch and creating something 100% 	incompatible.</p>

 The 	Boehm GC doesn't require metadata, so it has to guess what is a 	pointer by walking the stack and heap and looking for bit patterns 	that look like pointers! Therefore, because Boehm isn't true GC, it 	doesn't enable things like reflection. Also, Boehm can't compact 	memory.</p>

 GC 	code can give better performance because it has the exact hardware 	in front of it.

 You 	only need to <i class="calibre5">in principle</i> pause a program while doing GC. The 	good news is that in many types of applications, from word 	processors to web servers, a brief pause is acceptable. This number 	is proportional to the amount of memory in use by the application, 	and therefore obeys the “only pay for what you use” rule of 	engineering.<br class="calibre4"/>However, in certain situations, pausing is not 	acceptable, such as video games or code interacting with hardware. 	There are many solutions such as implementing GC via reference 	counting, or making it incremental and scheduling it proactively 	during idle moments, etc.  	</p>

 Firefox 	will get faster in certain ways when it is re-written in a modern 	programming language. One of the performance boosts will come when 	it throws away its Javascript interpreter.

 It 	took so much time because C libraries often use their own string 	classes, synchronization primitives, error handling schemes, etc. 	Furthermore, modern languages do a better job at many little details 	like backward compatibility.

 Another 	way to analyze the maintainability of code is to analyze the 	maintainability of the compilers for that code. One finds that C++ 	compilers are big, ugly and slow because the languages are big and 	complicated. If the tools for a language are complicated, it is also 	likely the code written in them will have maintainability issues. It 	is perfectly possible to build a language which looks nothing like 	C, but whose compiler emits C. My favorite C++ gotcha is the need to 	make destructors virtual.

 One 	of the things Microsoft changed was to simplify and improve the 	performance of how a Java developer called in to native operating 	system functionality. Java has always allowed developers to write 	non-portable, operating system-specific code when the operating 	system provided a feature that a developer wanted access to but that 	Java did not support. By definition this code was not 	cross-platform, so one would imagine that Microsoft-specific syntax 	to access Windows-specific features would not have been a big deal. 	In fact, the way a Java programmer would call the native 	functionality on Windows had the same syntax between Microsoft's RNI 	and Sun's JNI. It was only the way the native method was declared 	that was different. Microsoft did make other changes, such as adding 	a keyword, “delegate”, but if you search the web you can find 	many people who wished Sun had added that feature and code samples 	to enable that feature in Java.</p>

 Sharing 	code across languages has historically been very difficult. The 	search engine Lucene is a recent example of something which started 	in Java but has been forked into versions in PHP and C#.<br class="calibre4"/>There 	are many reasons for it being so difficult to share code between 	different languages. They have different ways of deploying the code, 	different naming conventions, and different low-level details. 	Interoperating layers usually adds significant performance costs 	because everything from the strings on up the stack have to be 	marshalled, which usually involves making a copy of the data. If you 	can't agree on what a string is, then you will have difficulty 	sharing code. (Going from C# to C/C++ is fast because a copy of the 	data doesn't need to be created — a C Unicode string is a subset 	of a C# string.)</p>

 Fortress's 	syntax is arbitrarily different from Java in ways not at all related 	to high performance computing (HPC). A programming language is by 	definition extensible by creating new functions and classes, and it 	is also possible to alter the runtime, without changing the 	language, to optimize it for specialized hardware, etc. The big 	challenge in HPC is to robustly divide up the work amongst a farm of 	servers, pass messages and maintain and monitor the system — new 	software, not new language features.</p>

 One 	other concern about Mono is that it doesn't use a copyleft license. 	Excerpt from the FAQ on the Mono website:<br class="calibre4"/>“When a developer 	contributes code to the C# compiler or the Mono runtime engine, we 	require that the author grants Novell the right to relicense his/her 	contribution under other licensing terms. This allows Novell to 	re-distribute the Mono source code to parties that might not want to 	use the GPL or LGPL versions of the code.

 If 	a distribution finds a bug in the Linux kernel, it will put a bug 	into the bug database. The fix usually goes into the next release of 	the software, but a distro can backport into their current version. 	The difference between the kernel in different distros is the 	version and the set of backports, which are usually not noticeable 	to applications.</p>

 Another 	important question that is not close to being answered: How does my 	music device plug into my car? A device should not expose itself as 	a set of files to your car radio because that requires your car to 	understand how to decode all the various formats. Even if the car 	does understand MP3, it won't understand audio bookmarks. My car 	radio wants to fast-forward through hour-long podcasts a couple of 	seconds at a time, whereas the RockBox OS on my iPod gets 	increasingly faster and is configurable in this regard. What we 	likely need is a streaming protocol: the iPod will implement 	functions like fast-forward, next song, show directory, search, 	etc.<br class="calibre4"/>A question: since you can understand voice that's 50% 	faster, should that playback setting be available in the car radio 	UI, or be a setting of audio files? Suppose you wanted to override 	that behavior, would you be able to do that through the UI of the 	radio?</p>

 Apple's 	kernel also contains pieces of the Mach kernel, but their OS 	contains much more code from BSD. In fact, I can see little to no 	benefit from using any Mach code as opposed to its equivalent from 	BSD. Some have described Apple's combined kernel as a software 	Frankenstein.</p>

 Microsoft 	isn't able to just give you a new kernel with updated hardware 	support without giving you a whole new OS.

Loyalty to a more powerful abuser — in spite of the danger 	that this loyalty puts the victim in — is common among victims of 	domestic abuse, battered partners and child abuse.

 You 	might not believe that, but I have the early bad reviews to prove 	it! Microsoft's software is considered unreliable today not because 	the developers don't care, but because they are burdened by old 	code, and have a development organization far too small for the vast 	scope of technology they release.

 In 	fact, if hardware companies did not finalize their hardware until 	their Linux driver was written, hardware itself would become more 	reliable.

 One 	solution is to build an OS that continuously and smoothly upgrades 	itself to the latest software, a feature that is not offered on many 	distributions today.

 There 	is also PNG and GIF for lossless compression, but they are not 	suitable for real-world images with continuous gradients like 	clouds, etc. I took a high quality 1.9 MB JPEG and converted it to 	PNG and it became 2.9 times bigger.<br class="calibre4"/>Interestingly, these lossless 	formats do a better job than JPEG for certain images like screen 	shots because JPEG doesn't handle the sharp transitions from black 	to white, etc. that you find on a computer screen. A JPEG of a 	screen shot is 2.2 times larger than an equivalent PNG. With a JPEG 	of the same size, you find it has added gray display artifacts at 	the black/white transitions.<br class="calibre4"/>PNG was only created because after 	GIF became popular, Compuserve started suing.</p>

 Even 	if the schema does change in an incompatible way, it should be 	possible to write a tiny program to update to the new schema – try 	doing that with a binary format.

 There 	could be other formats than XML which is not particularly efficient 	for computers to parse. Efficiency was never a part of the design, 	as the code was created after the spec.

 The 	tricky thing about building a standard is that new requirements can 	cause ripples throughout the design of a system. Imagine two people 	sitting in different countries collaborating on one file. The 	challenge is that the ODF file format was not made to be 	incremental, it was meant to represent an entire document. Do you 	send a new copy of the document over every time the user makes a 	change? This is very inefficient and yet doesn't tell the user what 	changed. Another solution is to use the undo stack, but it doesn't 	look like OpenDocument stores an undo stack with the document. They 	could just send around XML diffs, but the XML is not usually the 	in-memory representation of a document, in which case XML isn't 	easily usable! One solution is to have an object model (with 	functions like CreateTable) on top of the file format, and can be 	sent between computers, but the OpenDocument committee has not 	attacked this yet.<br class="calibre4"/>I look forward to seeing how they solve this 	problem, or whether they decide that while it is a doable feature, 	it is too hard and outside the scope of the OpenDocument standard. 	Software is infinitely malleable, but that doesn't mean you'll like 	what requirements have forced upon you!</p>

 I 	noticed that its high-resolution broke websites which work in 	pixels, and so screw up when pixels get 4 times smaller, by doing 	things like displaying only 3 words per line.<br class="calibre4"/>A much smaller 	advance in monitor technology is to use LEDs as the backlight for 	LCD monitors rather than fluorescent bulbs.

Fox offers a highly 	opinionated, fast-paced and entertaining brand of political debate 	that includes all sides of the political aisle. The top hosts may be 	largely conservative (though not necessarily Republican), but the 	guests frequently are not, creating an adversarial and combative 	arena that until recently was a rarity in American news coverage. 	Fox is unashamedly pro-American, a breath of fresh air in an age 	when US foreign policy is increasingly weak, muddled and confused.”</p>
