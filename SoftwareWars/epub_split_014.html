 Free Software Only Costs PCs</h2> <p class="calibre3">Creating a unified industrial software base built around free software will not only make PCs more powerful, but it will also allow us to push their intelligence everywhere, from cars to medical equipment<span>.</span><span><span> </span></span>Free software will be built because it is so valuable to businesses; everyone else will come along for the ride and get it for free.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The proprietary software model has hurt many of the smaller software markets. In fact, except for gaming business which is as much about artistry as software, Microsoft is nearly the last proprietary software company standing. When I was at Microsoft, our biggest competitors were companies such as Borland, WordPerfect, Corel, Lotus, Netscape and Sybase — names you never hear anymore.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">There is no Microsoft of educational software selling products used in every school. There are several companies selling proprietary products, perhaps receiving enough revenue to stay in business, but the proprietary software model has prevented them from achieving critical mass.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Recently, I saw an ad for a trivial software applet capable of converting a DVD to the iPod video format. Microsoft managed to convince everybody that each little software product is worth selling. Now you see why Stallman's analogy of proprietary software as tollbooths is apt — they serve as permanent, pervasive obstacles holding up progress for software that was written years earlier. Free software flows with much less friction. In fact, in the free software world, the definition of a PC operating system completely changes.</p>
