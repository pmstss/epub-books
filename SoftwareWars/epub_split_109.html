 The Outside World</h2> <i class="calibre5">In 1929, cars were unreliable and belched all sorts of noxious fumes into the atmosphere. Computers did not exist. Airplanes were slow and unsafe. Movies had just recently gotten sound. TV and FM radio did not exist. The iPod and cell phone were misspellings. DNA was just three letters and genetics non-existent. The stock market crashed and we were on our way to a depression.</i> <i class="calibre5">In 2009, cars are reliable and produce little noxious gases. There are billions of computers in the world, especially when you count the ones in cars, thermostats, cell phones, etc. Airplanes are fast, safe, and affordable. Home entertainment centers have surround sound and quality so good you think you are in the movie theater. TV is digital and FM is everywhere. Close to 200 million iPods and billions of cell phones have been sold. The human genome has been sequenced multiple times...and the stock market crashed. Many argue that we are headed for a deep recession, if not depression. It seems more than obvious to me that we need to import some of the methods of knowledge transfer from the technologists into the rest of our life structures.</i> <i class="calibre5">—<a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/whats-an-engineer-got-that-a-banker-doesnt/2/">Seymour Friedel</a>

 <h4 class="calibre19">Powering a free society</h4> <i class="calibre5">After a quarter-century of gas tax hikes, a ban on drilling for oil and a complete destruction of the nuclear power industry in America, I guess liberals can declare: Mission accomplished!</i> <i class="calibre5"> In response to skyrocketing gas prices, they say, practically in unison, “We can't drill our way out of this crisis.”</i> <i class="calibre5"> What does that mean? This is like telling a starving man, “You can't eat your way out of being hungry!” Finding more oil isn't going to increase the supply of oil?</i> <i class="calibre5"> It is the typical Democratic strategy to babble meaningless slogans, as if they have a plan. Their plan is: the permanent twilight of the human race. It's the only solution they can think of to deal with the beastly traffic on the LIE (Long Island Expressway).</i> <i class="calibre5"> Liberals complain that — as Barack Obama put it — there's “no way that allowing offshore drilling would lower gas prices right now. At best you are looking at five years or more down the road.”</i> <i class="calibre5"> This is as opposed to airplanes that run on woodchips, which should be up and running any moment now. Moreover, what was going on five years ago? Why didn't anyone propose drilling back then?</i> <i class="calibre5"> Say, you know what we need? We need a class of people paid to anticipate national crises and plan solutions in advance. It would be such an important job, the taxpayers would pay them salaries so they wouldn't have to worry about making a living and could just sit around anticipating crises.</i> <i class="calibre5"> If only we had had such a group — let's call them “elected representatives” — they could have proposed drilling five years ago!</i> <i class="calibre5">But of course we do pay people to anticipate national problems and propose solutions.

</i> <i class="calibre5"> I went through thick and thin in the nuclear plant licensing process. The Shoreham, New York, plant was in operation. It got up to well over 1% power, and then they shut it down. Democrat Governor Mario Cuomo made 'em drill holes in the reactor vessel so it could never be used again. And it was the first plant that had been built under the newest and safest regulations, and it took them years. It cost us well over a billion dollars, and they just wrote it off.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —<a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_042908/content/01125106.guest.html"><span>Jim</span></a>
, Shoreham Nuclear Regulatory Commission Project Manager</i> <i class="calibre5">The Alvin W. Vogtle Nuclear Generating Station in Burke County, Georgia, has two 1,200-MW reactors sitting on the Savannah River, directly across from the federal nuclear processing facilities in South Carolina. Now Southern Nuclear, which owns Vogtle, wants to build two new 1,000-MW reactors as part of the nuclear renaissance.  </i> <i class="calibre5">Environmental groups have immediately taken up the challenge, arguing that dredging the Savannah River to allow barge delivery of reactor parts will damage the river. The Savannah was dredged regularly for more than a century until the Army Corps of Engineers gave up in 1980 because nothing much was happening on the river. Now environmental groups say a renewal will ruin the environment. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has nodded agreement and will require an environmental impact statement before early site clearance can begin. That will probably add three years to the project.</i> <i class="calibre5">—<a href="http://www.spectator.org/archives/2008/11/10/obamas-looming-energy-disaster"><span>William Tucker</span></a>
</i> <p class="calibre3">Leonardo Cavallaro, a man who designed nuclear power plants until the mid-70s when the industry collapsed, told me that “Energy changes everything.”<a name="sdfootnote122anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote122sym" id="sdfootnote122anc"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a>
 Each invention which decreased the amount of energy man himself had to expend to accomplish a task increased his quality of life. The use of the animals, water wheels to mill grain, steam, electricity and batteries have each made our lives easier. Few things would further increase our quality of life more than making energy ten times cheaper than it is today.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>One of the biggest reasons for offshoring of manufacturing jobs outside of the US is the cost of energy. It takes a lot of energy to bend steel! The idea that it was okay to offshore manufacturing because America is moving to a service economy is one of the dumbest ideas ever uttered because it doesn't recognize that it isn't until you do something that you figure out </span><i class="calibre5">how</i><span> to do it.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">Every step that you take both solves today's problems, and sets you up to take on new problems. At Microsoft, we had a phrase “Crawl, Walk, Run” and it applies to other sectors as well as software:</p>
 <i class="calibre5">Make TVs -&gt; Make robots which make TVs -&gt; Make robots which make your bed</i> <i class="calibre5">99 cent plastic toy -&gt; materials sciences for toys -&gt; materials sciences changing all building materials</i> <i class="calibre5"> Food production -&gt; genetically modified food -&gt; genetically modified everything</i> <p class="calibre3">In 1996, President Clinton vetoed legislation to increase drilling for oil inside the US because he said it wouldn't do anything for 10 years. 10 years later, with record gas prices, many in Congress said they are against it because it won't do anything for 10 years. Either people in our government are incapable of thinking long-term, or they have been bribed by special interests and treat us like fools.</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Free Markets</h4> <p class="calibre3"> <img src="wordpress_html_3f82fc1c.jpg" border="0" class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre4"/>Congress creates the problem, blames the free market, and uses the crisis as an excuse to create more government.  </p>

Underlying most arguments against the 	free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.</i>  <i class="calibre5"> Everybody agrees that socialism has been a failure. Everybody agrees that capitalism has been a success...yet everybody is extending socialism!</i> <i class="calibre5"> Spending by government in 1989 amounts to about 45 percent of national income.

</i>  <i class="calibre5">So you think that money is the root of all evil? Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value.</i>  	<i class="calibre5"> 	—Ayn Rand, <i class="calibre5">Atlas Shrugged</i></i>  <i class="calibre5">Where freedom is real, equality is the passion of the masses. Where equality is real, freedom is the passion of a small minority.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Eric Hoffer</i> <p class="calibre3">There is a correlation between the free market and free software, as both are powered by innovation created by millions of disconnected individuals, acting in their own self-interest — scratching their own itch. The collaborative process in free software which weeds out the bad ideas is very similar to what happens in the free market. Innovation might be disruptive, but the alternative is stagnation, bad in both software and life.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Healthcare is the political topic <i class="calibre5">du jour</i>, and many advocate the government involvement in creating a “public option” to increase “choice and competition” in healthcare. But in the Microsoft antitrust trial, the government never argued the way to increase competition in software would be for the government to get into the business, and if they had, they would have been laughed out of the courtroom! What America the world's only superpower in 200 years was that it had the freest economy. History has demonstrated repeatedly that companies innovate much faster than the government; the free market is <i class="calibre5">us</i>. Government doesn't innovate because it isn't set up to do that; every expense is a pre-planned line item in the budget. No government employee can go to work one day and ask their boss for some extra money so they can develop a new idea to make <i class="calibre5">more</i> money. In fact, working for such organizations must drain the humanity from its workers.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Many think that the free market is evil because the spoils are unequally distributed. What they are missing is something that Milton Friedman wrote:  </p>
 <i class="calibre5"> Industrial progresses, mechanical improvement, all of the great wonders of the modern era have meant relatively little to the wealthy. The rich in Ancient Greece would have benefited hardly at all from modern plumbing: running servants replaced running water. Television and radio, the Patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians and actors in their home, could have the leading actors as domestic retainers. Ready-to-wear clothing, supermarkets all these and many other modern developments would have added little to their life. The great achievements of Western Capitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person. These achievements have made available to the masses conveniences and amenities that were previously the exclusive prerogative of the rich and powerful.</i> <p class="calibre3">Today, we are told to despise many types of corporations, from energy to health insurance. This ignores the social utility they create in employing people and providing value to customers. All transactions in a free market are voluntary; whereas if you don't like a product or service your government is providing, there is no way to opt out of paying for it. It is inexplicable that so many, especially geeks who are by nature anti-establishment, want to hand their their property and liberty over to unaccountable bureaucrats who run a monopoly that Microsoft would jealous of.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Free market capitalism is also a human rights issue: it is about the right to make and purchase what one wishes and to keep the fruits of one's labor. Even the most egalitarian programmer would never suggest that Linus should earn the same amount as a newbie programmer. Profits have to be earned in a free market, and it generates more innovation and competition. A recent newspaper headline proclaimed that there is a shortage of family doctors in America. The free market can handle this: those doctors can raise their fees, which will also encourage more doctors to go into this specialty. This is the “invisible hand” described in Adam Smith's <i class="calibre5">The Wealth of Nations</i>, written way back in 1776.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Greed is not bad — it is what gets people out of bed in the morning. The dream of making a million dollars for someone else doesn't provide the same motivation as making it for yourself! Supporters of the free market aren't against welfare nets, but they are against a welfare state and punishing success.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Here is a quote from Mark Levin's <i class="calibre5">Liberty and Tyranny</i>:  </p>
 <i class="calibre5"> The Statist is constantly agitating for government action. And in furtherance of that purpose, he speaks in the tongue of the demagogue, concocting one pretext and grievance after another to manipulate public perceptions and build popular momentum for the divestiture of liberty and property from its rightful possessors. The industrious, earnest, and successful are demonized as perpetrators of various offenses against the public good, which justifies governmental intervention on behalf of the endless parade of “victims.”  In this way, the perpetrator and the victim are subordinated to the government's authority — the former by outright theft, the latter by dependent existence.</i> <i class="calibre5"> The Statist veils his pursuits in moral indignation, intoning the injustices and inequities of liberty and life itself, for which only he can provide justice and bring a righteous resolution. And when the resolution proves elusive, as it undoubtedly does — whether the Marxist promise of “the workers' paradise” or the Great Society “war on poverty” —  the Statist demands even more authority to wring out the imperfections of mankind's existence. Failure is not the product of his beliefs but merely want of power and resources. Thus are born endless rationalizations for seizing ever more governmental authority.</i> <p class="calibre3">Paul Krugman, who won a Nobel Prize in economics, wrote: “If the rich get richer, the poor and middle-class must get poorer as a matter of arithmetic.” It is stunning that he doesn't understand that innovation brings <i class="calibre5">new</i> wealth to a society. The sad part about today's intelligentsia is that they do not accept even decades-old economic theories like how the free market generates the most prosperous society.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Nothing would improve our world more than having more people familiar with the benefits of the free market, a concept as subtle as free software. Anyone who thinks their government ought to do more than enforce the border, create an army and a provide a basic welfare net should read Milton Friedman's </span><i class="calibre5">Free to Choose</i><span>. His writings suggest profound implications for our government which is steadily intruding itself into every aspect of our lives from cradle to grave. We citizens should read his work, and demand our elected representatives implement the ideas contained therein. If a medical doctor didn't follow scientific advancements of the last 40 years, he would be sued for malpractice, but somehow in government, economic malpractice is allowed!</span></p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">The Legislature</h4> <i class="calibre5"><span>The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. Before the </span>obvious economic failure of Eastern European socialism, it was widely thought that a centrally planned economy would deliver not only “social justice” but also a more efficient use of economic resources. This notion appears eminently sensible at first glance. But it proves to overlook the fact that the totality of resources that one could employ in such a plan is simply not knowable to anybody, and therefore can hardly be centrally controlled.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —<span><span>Frederick </span></span>Hayek, <i class="calibre5">The Fatal Conceit</i></i> <i class="calibre5">Knowledge is one of the scarcest of all resources in any economy. Even when leaders have much more knowledge and insight than the average member of the society, they are unlikely to have nearly as much knowledge and insight as exists scattered among millions of people subject to their governance.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —Thomas Sowell, <i class="calibre5">Basic Economics</i></i> <i class="calibre5">To provide for us in our necessities is not in the power of Government. It would be a vain presumption in statesmen to think they can do it.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —Edmund Burke, 1795</i> <i class="calibre5">Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —C.S.

My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results 	from too much government.</i>  <i class="calibre5"> —Thomas Jefferson</i> <i class="calibre5">The government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —Milton Friedman</i>  	<i class="calibre5">We 	don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough; 	we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.</i> 	<i class="calibre5"> 	—Ronald Reagan, 1989</i>  <i class="calibre5">No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size.

Barry Goldwater thinks we can.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —Ronald Reagan, 1964</i> <i class="calibre5">Only a crisis, real or perceived, produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically inevitable.</i> <i class="calibre5"> —Milton<span> Friedman</span></i> <p class="calibre3">The problem with America is the high cost of energy, healthcare, education, regulation, litigation, and taxation. All decrease the rate of progress and push jobs offshore. All of these problems can be fixed, but it is the US Congress who must fix it. They could pass legislation to fix all these problems in a small number of years if the citizens demanded it. Plans for all manner of reform have been sitting around for decades, waiting for the political will. Ronaldus Magnus talked about the need to reform the Social Security ponzi scheme in the 1960s, and today we are still merely talking! America is a few votes away from so much progress.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3">Before legislation can be voted on in the Senate, it needs a 60 vote requirement to end debate. This is a good check and balance because it can allow a minority to keep out a bad government solution, which can be worse than the problem. However, for the long-standing problems that have existed in the United States, it is entrenched interests in the Senate that have stalled progress. A lot of people blame President Bush for the problems in the world because his party controlled both houses of Congress for several years, but this ignores the 60 vote requirement necessary to pass any non-trivial legislation.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Unfortunately, lots of what the Congress does involves so many details that get lost on the public, which is why the media play such an important role in educating or even shaping public opinion.</p>

At many of the colleges I’ve taught at or consulted for, a perusal of the speakers list and the required readings in the campus bookstore convinced me that a student could probably go through four years without ever encountering a right-of-center view portrayed in a positive light.</i> <i class="calibre5"> A sociologist I know recalls that his decision to become a registered Republican caused “a sensation” at his university. “It was as if I had become a child molester,” he said. He eventually quit academia to join a think tank because “you don’t want to be in a department where everyone hates your guts.”</i> <i class="calibre5"> Daniel Klein of George Mason University and Charlotta Stern of Stockholm University looked at all the reliable published studies of professors’ political and ideological attachments. They found that conservatives and libertarians are outnumbered by liberals and Marxists by roughly two to one in economics, more than five to one in political science, and by 20 to one or more in anthropology and sociology.</i> <i class="calibre5"> I doubt that legions of leftist professors have set out to purge academia of Republican dissenters. I believe that for the most part the biases conservative academics face are subtle, even unintentional. When making hiring decisions and confronted with several good candidates, we college professors, like anyone else, tend to select people like ourselves.</i> <i class="calibre5"> Unfortunately, subtle biases in how conservative students and professors are treated in the classroom and in the job market have very unsubtle effects on the ideological makeup of the professoriate.

 <p class="calibre3"><span>A free society requires educated citizens for good governance. </span>The world we live in is very complex, which is why the media have such an important role. Unfortunately, the mainstream media is mostly filled with liberals<span> who push a big-government agenda, and it has been that way for many decades. The press in America are mostly free of government funding and control, but if they advocate for government-provided childcare, higher taxes, and other trappings of socialism, what is the difference? The reason we don't have nuclear power plants in America is not simply because the Congress has obstructed this progress, but because the media indelibly etched the Three Mile Island nuclear accident as a catastrophe into the consciousness of America, even though no one died.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>While there are conservatives in the media such as at Fox News and </span><i class="calibre5">The Wall Street Journal</i><span>, nearly all the rest, from the big three TV networks of ABC, CBS, and NBC, to the cable networks of CNN and MSNBC, to all of the major newspapers from </span><i class="calibre5">The Washington Post</i><span>,</span><i class="calibre5"> to The New York Times</i><span>, and The </span><i class="calibre5">LA Times</i><span>, lean Democrat.</span><span><a name="sdfootnote123anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote123sym" id="sdfootnote123anc"><sup class="calibre7">4</sup></a>

<span> that </span><i class="calibre5">The Kansas City Star</i><span>, which serves a center-right community “has created a product, both in its reporting and in its editorial, much better suited to the residents of say, Boston or Seattle, than of Kansas City.”</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>Not only is the media biased in the US, it appears to be biased around the world as well. There was a recent </span><a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23400983-details/BBC+accused+of+institutional+'trendy+left-wing+bias'/article.do"><span><span>study</span></span></a>
<span> commissioned by the BBC which found </span><i class="calibre5">itself</i><span> to be guilty of a “left-wing bias,” and a “bias of omission.” This study came out 1.5 years ago; a company could reinvent itself in that time, but I wonder if the BBC has made </span>any <span>changes? The bias in the news filters to the outside world: a study found that late-night comics skewer Republicans by a ratio of 7 – 1.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">Everyone has personal biases, but <span>if </span><i class="calibre5">The New York Times</i><span> is an intellectually honest newspaper, why hasn't it endorsed a Republican for President in the last 60 years? If Ronald Reagan was the great president as he is now generally accepted to have been, why did they miss two chances to endorse him? Surely there are countless other things, with hindsight of only a few years, that they have gotten wrong.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">The key to successful propaganda is two things: repetition, and lie by omission. A good example is how the media have repeatedly <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/11/politics/uwire/main3927378.shtml">reported</a>
 that President Bush is lazy, using the fact that he has taken a record number of “vacation days”:</p>
 <i class="calibre5"> President Bush recently spent his 879th day at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, breaking former President Reagan's record for taking vacations from the White House.</i> <p class="calibre3">Note how a vacation day is defined as one not at the White House. However, it leaves out the fact that a President takes the resources of the White House with him wherever he goes, and President Bush has had meetings with foreign leaders, and with his various national security and economic teams at his Texas ranch. The media leave all these facts out, and just report again and again that they have “the numbers” to prove that Bush is lazy — even though he gets up at 5 am and exercises every day.</p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>It is with repetition and the ability to lie by omission that the media can mold minds in any direction they choose. I have Russian friends from Microsoft who lived in the Soviet Union during the days of </span><i class="calibre5">Pravda</i><span>, and yet they don't seem to imagine that those same propaganda techniques could and do exist here. I believe the bias of the media is one of the greatest ongoing scandals of our age.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>How can the media be leftward in this center-right country? Why doesn't the free market fix this? The answer is that the barriers to </span><span>entry for a newspaper or TV station are very high. If you live in New </span><span>York, you read </span><i class="calibre5">The New York Times</i>, a<span>nd even those who don't like its extreme political bent read it for other reasons such as its Arts section.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">Like creating a newspaper, creating a TV network is also very difficult; CBS, NBC and ABC have been around for almost 70 years. Even though there is now cable news, the big 3 TV networks have 10 times as many viewers.  </p>
 <p class="calibre3"><span>While Fox News has higher ratings than CNN and MSNBC </span>combined, <span>the rest of the media have colluded to discredit it as a mere propaganda arm of the Republican party. I've talked to a fair number of fellow software engineers who scoff at the idea of Fox as a legitimate news organization; the simplest way to squelch other viewpoints is to discredit them like this. Fox News was long-anchored by Brit Hume, who worked for ABC News for 23 years without getting fired for being a nutcase, but now it is presumed that he is.</span><span><a name="sdfootnote124anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote124sym" id="sdfootnote124anc"><sup class="calibre7">5</sup></a>

 of Obama voters found that 86% knew about the scandal that Sarah Palin had spent $150,000 on clothes, and 94% knew that Palin had a pregnant teenage daughter, but only 40% knew that the Democrats controlled Congress, only 17% knew that Obama won his first election by getting all of his opponents kicked off the ballot, and only 18% knew that Biden quit a previous presidential campaign because of a plagiarism scandal. While many millions of people around the world know many “details” about Sarah Palin, they know nothing about how Joe Biden was wrong during the Cold War, voted against the first Gulf War, etc. Even though they've only learned half the truth, they don't even notice! All of these examples show how a bias of omission can shape public opinion.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In spite of the fact that I was not an Obama supporter, I believe he could have a great presidency if he tackles some of the longstanding problems in our country. However, as it isn't clear he appreciates the power of the free market, I don't know if it will happen.</p>
