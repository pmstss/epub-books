 Sun sued Microsoft</h2> <p class="calibre3">Another Sun mistake was getting into a war with Microsoft over Java. Microsoft's tools division was an active participant in Java for its first several years, and PC Magazine wrote in 1997 that: “Microsoft's Java environment was the fastest and most compatible on our tests.”</p>
 <p class="calibre3">When Microsoft improved Java in certain ways that by definition were incompatible, Sun sued them. Microsoft's changes to Java were minor, the features justifiable, and the incompatibilities almost non-existent.<a name="sdfootnote67anc" href="epub_split_112.html#sdfootnote67sym" id="sdfootnote67anc"><sup class="calibre7">3</sup></a>
 A public lawsuit, the exchange of $20 million in damages, and much bitterness ensued.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Eventually, Microsoft quit supporting Java and went off to create C# instead. C# might be considered Java 2.0. While it is very similar to Java, it had five years of refinement and applied Microsoft's many years of experience as a dominant force in the tools business. C# created unnecessary chaos and confusion in the industry and allowed Microsoft to be 100% incompatible with Java rather than just .01% incompatible. Microsoft would not have created C# if Sun hadn't sued them.</p>
