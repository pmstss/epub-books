This is a case where Office has to avoid doing something to destroy Windows.</i> <i class="calibre5">I would be glad to explain at a greater length.</i> <i class="calibre5">Likewise this love of the standard DAV in Office/Exchange is a huge problem. I would also like to make sure people understand this as well.</i> <p class="calibre3"><span>T</span>o use the Internet, you need software that supports two big standards: TCP/HTTP and HTML. There is no “HTML” standard competing with an “HTMM” standard, as the idea is silly on its face, yet such redundancies exist in many other areas in the world of bits today. When you can't agree on a file format, your ability to exchange information goes from 1 to 0.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Free software has been a part of the Internet since the beginning. In fact, a website needs to send you software, in the form of HTML and JavaScript, in order for you to have something to look at and interact with. It is easy to learn how a website does its magic as the tags of an HTML document are self-describing and, on top of that, there is an organization called W3C whose job is to fully describe them.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In contrast, to display a Word or WordPerfect document, you had to reverse-engineer a complicated binary file format! This prevented their widespread use as the standard document format of the Internet.</p>
