 		The Desktop</h2> 	  <i class="calibre5">The <i class="calibre5">only strategy</i> in getting people to switch to your product is to <i class="calibre5">eliminate barriers</i>. Imagine that it's 1991. The dominant spreadsheet, with 100% market share, is Lotus 123. You're the product manager for Microsoft Excel. Ask yourself: what are the barriers to switching? What keeps users from becoming Excel customers tomorrow? Think of these barriers as an obstacle course that people have to run before you can count them as your customers. If you start out with a field of 1000 runners, about half of them will trip on the tires; half of the survivors won't be strong enough to jump the wall; half of <i class="calibre5">those</i> survivors will fall off the rope ladder into the mud, and so on, until only 1 or 2 people actually overcome all the hurdles. With 8 or 9 barriers, <i class="calibre5">everybody</i> will have one non-negotiable deal killer.</i> <i class="calibre5">This calculus means that eliminating barriers to switching is the most important thing you have to do if you want to take over an existing market, because eliminating <i class="calibre5">just one barrier</i> will likely <i class="calibre5">double</i> your sales. Eliminate two barriers, and you'll double your sales again. Microsoft looked at the list of Lotus 123 barriers and worked on <i class="calibre5">all of them</i>:</i> <table width="100%" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" class="calibre10"><col width="128*" class="calibre11"/><col width="128*" class="calibre11"/><tr valign="TOP" class="calibre12"><td width="50%" class="calibre13"> 			<p class="calibre14"> 			<b class="calibre8">Barrier</b></p>

</i> <p class="calibre3">Free software developers have had a long row to hoe. As proprietary software has been the dominant model for decades, many geeks have had to live with one foot in each world; Linux programmers today are often forced to use Macs, Windows and other proprietary software.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">The good news is that a Linux PC does a <span>reasonably</span> good job of interoperating with proprietary hardware and software, especially Microsoft technology. Today, Linux supports the Microsoft Office file format, Windows Media file formats and protocols, MSN Instant Messenger protocols, Microsoft file systems, C#, and much more. The implementations aren't perfect, but just the most popular 95% of a standard is good enough for most. In fact, by tackling the easy and more important portions, the codebases are smaller and simpler than their Microsoft counterparts.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In general, when a free software application supports a file type or protocol, the support is good, but there are still Microsoft formats such as Publisher, Money, and Access whose lack of support is problematic today. Having worked on Microsoft Publisher, I can say it is about 5,000 lines of code for OpenOffice to support reading these documents, which is not a big deal. The work can be done by an enterprising volunteer, or via a bounty.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">As mentioned in the Apple section, one of Linux's most surprising capabilities is its ability to run Windows applications. Given a complete operating system, implementing the Win32 <span>syntax for similar functionality</span> is not difficult. Therefore, a backup strategy for supporting proprietary file formats is to run the proprietary Windows programs on Linux.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">I was able to switch to using Linux 100% of the time, and cannot foresee a reason to switch back, but others are not so lucky. Work in a number of areas needs to continue.</p>
