More Free Software</h2> <i class="calibre5">If you look at the magazines about the use of the GNU/Linux system, they're filled with ads for non-free software that you could run on top of the system. Those ads have a common message. They say: “Non-free software is good for you.” They call these things “value-added packages,” which makes a statement about their values. I call them “freedom-subtracted packages.” Because if you have installed a free operating system, then now you are living in the free world. You enjoy the benefits of liberty that we worked for so many years to give you.</i> <i class="calibre5">—Richard Stallman</i> <p class="calibre3">One of the best ways to cure the problems of free software is simply to create more of it. If you talk to someone about their Linux experience, they might complain that they can't play DVDs out of the box, that some proprietary drivers are missing, or that iTunes or other proprietary software does not natively run on Linux.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Getting vendors to provide their proprietary software on Linux might sound like a great help, but building a completely free software stack should be the principal focus. Richard Stallman wrote:</p>
 <i class="calibre5"> Adding non-free software to the GNU/Linux system may increase the popularity, if by popularity we mean the number of people using some of GNU/Linux in combination with non-free software. But at the same time, it implicitly encourages the community to accept non-free software as a good thing, and forget the goal of freedom. It is no use driving faster if you can’t stay on the road.</i> <i class="calibre5">Some GNU/Linux operating system distributions add proprietary packages to the basic free system, and they invite users to consider this an advantage, rather than a step backwards from freedom.</i> <p class="calibre3"> Richard Stallman looks at free software as a struggle requiring constant vigilance, and he is correct. Linux is just like the real world in that respect: the parts that don't have freedom are the worst parts. Ultimately, it is good news if the solution to your problem is to do more of what you're already doing as this means you are heading in the right direction, and success is possible.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">In addition, proprietary software is generally an older, decrepit distraction. Microsoft's profitable products are simultaneously burdened by decrepit code, as is much of the industry's successful proprietary software. Adobe Photoshop is one of the most popular tools used by graphics designers today, and one of Adobe's <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/11/photoshop_as_se.html"><span>employees</span></a>
 wrote of Photoshop:</p>
 <i class="calibre5"> In “One Piece At a Time”, Johnny Cash tells the story of building a Cadillac from 20 years' worth of evolving, mismatched parts. I've gotta say, I know the feeling. Photoshop has been accreting power &amp; users for the better part of two decades, and looking at some parts of Photoshop is like counting the rings in a tree: you can gauge when certain features arrived by the dimensions &amp; style of the dialog. No one wants to work with — or work on — some shambling, bloated monster of a program.</i> <p class="calibre3">I think proprietary software, if it becomes popular and long-lived, is destined to become a mess because it does everything by itself rather than leveraging free software components. Furthermore, it doesn't receive the constant tending that a garden the size of a city would require. If Adobe were to put a team of 100 developers on Photoshop to clean things up, it would no longer be the profitable product it is today, even with its $1,700 price tag.</p>
