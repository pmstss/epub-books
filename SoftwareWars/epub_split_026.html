 Copyleft and Capitalism</h2> <p class="calibre3"><span>With the GPL freedoms comes one important responsibility: ensuring future enhancements to free code </span>have<span> to stay as free as the original code. This encourages a scientific community to stay that way, but is a responsibility only to the set of users who later choose to become creators.</span></p>
 <p class="calibre3">Software protected by copyleft is called free software, but it is not truly free because of the payback system that ensures future improvement to it will also be made free. There is no free lunch in this world, and copyleft <span>ensures</span> that people are giving back. The copyleft obligation is necessary but not expensive.</p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Necessary</h4> <p class="calibre3">The reason it is necessary to have copyleft is that only 100% free software is something <i class="calibre5">someone else</i> can further improve. <span>Improving a piece of free software, and making the enhancements proprietary, </span>effectively makes that entire piece of software proprietary. You need access to an entire codebase to be able make changes to anywhere in it. Denying free availability of code enhancements<span> creates a new boundary between science and alchemy.</span></p>
 <h4 class="calibre19">Not Expensive</h4> <i class="calibre5"> An equitable and effective intellectual property system must take into account both first creators and those who come later to build upon their work.</i> <i class="calibre5"> â€”<a href="http://www.ced.org/docs/report/report_healthcare2007dcc.pdf"><span>Committee for Economic Development</span></a>
</i> <p class="calibre3">Free software is not expensive because, in practical terms, advancements in software are nearly always based on existing knowledge and are very small in scope. What you must give back is much smaller than what you have freely received.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">When Linus first released Linux, it was a mere 10,000 lines of code. He has since received 8.2 million lines in return, worth 4,000 man-years, or $400 million. Free software, like science, is a pyramid scheme that works. The idea that someone gives you $400 million worth of technology for free means that it is likely you will not need to do much to get it to work for you, and your copyleft obligation will be a very small fraction of what you have freely received.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A change in software is usually 10-100 hundred lines of code, which is .001% to .01% of a million-line codebase. Technology advances in a steady, stepwise fashion. Therefore, it is important that once a piece of software is free, every little advancement to it is also made free. Wikipedia and Linux both require the copyleft obligation, and I believe this is an important part of their success. They also demonstrate that the copyleft obligation is enough to sustain development of free software, without involving license fees.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">Free software positions other people as the beneficiaries of your solutions, so they can then focus on other problems, to your benefit. Free software allows for an optimal division of labor, performed by people who don't necessarily understand the whole picture, but are just trying to make the software work better for them, or a customer of theirs.</p>
 <p class="calibre3">A free license doesn't take away your ability to benefit from your work. And as long as it doesn't take away your ability to benefit, there will always be motivation to write free software. Just as the public availability of scientific advancements has not decreased the motivation to do science, the free flow of software innovations does not threaten to undermine the software market. If people only make changes to software when they want to, and those changes are captured for others to use, no one is worse off. It helps others, and it likely helps the creator because writing software is hard work.</p>
